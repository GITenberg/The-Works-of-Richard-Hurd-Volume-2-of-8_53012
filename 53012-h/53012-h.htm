IDEA OF UNIVERSAL POETRY.</h2>

<p>When we speak of poetry, as an <i>art</i>, we
mean <i>such a way or method of treating a subject,
as is found most pleasing and delightful
to us</i>. In all other kinds of literary composition,
pleasure is subordinate to <small>USE</small>: in poetry
only, <small>PLEASURE</small> is the end, to which use itself
(however it be, for certain reasons, always pretended)
must submit.</p>

<p>This <i>idea</i> of the end of poetry is no novel
one, but indeed the very same which our great
philosopher entertained of it; who gives it as
the essential note of this part of learning&mdash;<small>THAT
IT SUBMITS THE SHEWS OF THINGS TO THE
DESIRES OF THE MIND: WHEREAS REASON DOTH
BUCKLE AND BOW THE MIND UNTO THE NATURE
OF THINGS</small>. For to <i>gratify the desires of the
mind</i>, is to <small>PLEASE</small>: <i>Pleasure</i> then, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
idea of Lord Bacon, is the ultimate and appropriate
end of poetry; for the sake of which
it accommodates itself to <i>the desires of the
mind</i>, and doth not (as other kinds of writing,
which are under the controul of <i>reason</i>) <i>buckle
and bow the mind to the nature of things</i>.</p>

<p>But they, who like a principle the better
for seeing it in Greek, may take it in the words
of an old philosopher, <span class="smcap">Eratosthenes</span>, who affirmed&mdash;ποιητὴν
πάντα στοχάζεσθαι ψυχαγωγίας,
οὐ διδασκαλίας&mdash;of which words, the
definition given above, is the translation.</p>

<p>This <i>notion</i> of the end of poetry, if kept
steadily in view, will unfold to us all the mysteries
of the poetic art. There needs but to
evolve the philosopher’s idea, and to apply it,
as occasion serves. <i>The art of poetry</i> will be,
universally, <small>THE ART OF PLEASING</small>; and all its
<i>rules</i>, but so many <small>MEANS</small>, which experience
finds most conducive to that end;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sic <small>ANIMIS</small> natum inventumque poema <small>JUVANDIS</small>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Aristotle has delivered and explained these
rules, so far as they respect one species of
poetry, the <i>dramatic</i>, or, more properly
speaking, the <i>tragic</i>: And when such a writer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
as he, shall do as much by the other species,
then, and not till then, a complete <small>ART OF
POETRY</small> will be formed.</p>

<p>I have not the presumption to think myself,
in any degree, equal to this arduous task:
But from the idea of this art, as given above,
an ordinary writer may undertake to deduce
some general conclusions, concerning <i>Universal
Poetry</i>, which seem preparatory to those
nicer disquisitions, concerning its <i>several sorts
or species</i>.</p>

<p>I. It follows from that <small>IDEA</small>, that it should
neglect no advantage, that fairly offers itself,
of appearing in such a dress or mode of language,
as is most <i>taking</i> and agreeable to us.
We may expect then, in the language or style
of poetry, a choice of such words as are most
sonorous and expressive, and such an arrangement
of them as throws the discourse out of
the ordinary and common phrase of conversation.
Novelty and variety are certain sources
of pleasure: a construction of words, which is
not vulgar, is therefore more suited to the ends
of poetry, than one which we are every day
accustomed to in familiar discourse. Some
manners of placing them are, also, more agreeable
to the ear, than others: Poetry, then, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
studious of these, as it would by all means,
not manifestly absurd, give pleasure: And
hence a certain musical cadence, or what we
call <i>Rhythm</i>, will be affected by the poet.</p>

<p>But, of all the means of adorning and enlivening
a discourse by words, which are infinite,
and perpetually grow upon us, as our
knowledge of the tongue, in which we write,
and our skill in adapting it to the ends of
poetry, increases, there is none that pleases
more, than <i>figurative expression</i>.</p>

<p>By <i>figurative expression</i>, I would be understood
to mean, here, that which respects
<i>the pictures or images of things</i>. And this
sort of figurative expression is universally
pleasing to us, because it tends to impress on
the mind the most distinct and vivid conceptions;
and truth of representation being of less
account in this way of composition, than the
liveliness of it, poetry, as such, will delight
in tropes and figures, and those the most
strongly and forceably expressed. And though
the <i>application</i> of figures will admit of great
variety, according to the nature of the subject,
and the <i>management</i> of them must be suited
to the taste and apprehension of the people, to
whom they are addressed, yet, in some way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
or other, they will find a place in all works of
poetry; and they who object to the use of
them, only shew that they are not capable of
being pleased by this sort of composition, or
do, in effect, interdict the thing itself.</p>

<p>The ancients looked for so much of this force
and spirit of expression in whatever they dignified
with the name of <i>poem</i>, that Horace
tells us it was made a question by some, whether
comedy were rightly referred to this class,
because it differed only, in point of measure,
from mere prose.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Idcirco quidam, comoedia necne poema<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esset, quaesivere: quod acer spiritus, ac vis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec <i>verbis</i>, nec rebus inest: nisi quod pede certo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Differt sermoni, sermo merus&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author">Sat. l. I. iv.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But they might have spared their doubt, or
at least have resolved it, if they had considered
that comedy adopts as much of this <i>force and
spirit of words</i>, as is consistent with the <i>nature</i>
and <i>degree</i> of that pleasure, which it pretends
to give. For the name of poem will belong
to every composition, whose primary end
is to <i>please</i>, provided it be so constructed as to
afford <i>all</i> the pleasure, which its kind or <i>sort</i>
will permit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>II. From the idea of the <i>end</i> of poetry, it
follows, that not only figurative and tropical
terms will be employed in it, as <i>these</i>, by the
images they convey, and by the air of novelty
which such indirect ways of speaking carry
with them, are found most delightful to us,
but also that <small>FICTION</small>, in the largest sense of
the word, is essential to poetry. For its purpose
is, not to delineate truth simply, but to
present it in the most taking forms; not to reflect
the real face of things, but to illustrate
and adorn it; not to represent the fairest objects
only, but to represent them in the fairest
lights, and to heighten all their beauties up to
the possibility of their natures; nay, to <i>outstrip</i>
nature, and to address itself to our wildest
fancy, rather than to our judgment and cooler
sense.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Οὔτ’ ἐπιδερκτὰ τάδ’ ἀνδράσιν, οὔτ’ ἐπακουστὰ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Οὔτε νόῳ περίληπτα&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As sings one of the profession<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, who seems to
have understood his privileges very well.</p>

<p>For there is something in the mind of man,
sublime and elevated, which prompts it to
overlook obvious and familiar appearances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
and to feign to itself other and more extraordinary;
such as correspond to the extent of its
own powers, and fill out all the faculties and
capacities of our souls. This restless and aspiring
disposition, poetry, first and principally,
would indulge and flatter; and thence takes its
name of <i>divine</i>, as if some power, above <i>human</i>,
conspired to lift the mind to these exalted
conceptions.</p>

<p>Hence it comes to pass, that it deals in
apostrophes and invocations; that it impersonates
the virtues and vices; peoples all creation
with new and living forms; calls up infernal
spectres to terrify, or brings down celestial
natures to astonish, the imagination; assembles,
combines, or connects its ideas, at pleasure;
in short, prefers not only the agreeable,
and the graceful, but, as occasion calls upon
her, the vast, the incredible, I had almost
said, the impossible, to the obvious truth and
nature of things. For all this is but a feeble
expression of that magic virtue of poetry, which
our Shakespear has so forcibly described in
those well-known lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rowling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth glance from heav’n to earth, from earth to heav’n;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
<span class="i0">And, as Imagination bodies forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns them to shape, and gives to aery nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A focal habitation and a name.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the received system of manners or
religion in any country, happens to be so constituted
as to suit itself in some degree to this
extravagant turn of the human mind, we may
expect that poetry will seize it with avidity,
will dilate upon it with pleasure, and take a
pride to erect its specious wonders on so proper
and convenient a ground. Whence it cannot
seem strange that, of all the forms in which
poetry has appeared, that of <i>pagan fable</i>, and
<i>gothic romance</i>, should, in their turns, be
found the most alluring to the true poet. For,
in defect of these advantages, he will ever adventure,
in some sort, to supply their place
with others of his own invention; that is, he
will mould every system, and convert every
subject, into the most amazing and miraculous
form.</p>

<p>And this is that I would say, at present, of
these two requisites of universal poetry, namely,
<i>that licence of expression</i>, which we call the
<i>style</i> of poetry, and <i>that licence of representation</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
which we call <i>fiction</i>. The <i>style</i> is,
as it were, the body of poetry; <i>fiction</i>, is its
soul. Having, thus, taken the privilege of a
poet to create a Muse, we have only now to
give her a voice, or more properly to <i>tune</i> it,
and then she will be in a condition, as one of
her favourites speaks, <span class="smcap">to ravish all the Gods</span>.
For</p>

<p>III. It follows from the same idea of the
<i>end</i>, which poetry would accomplish, that not
only Rhythm, but <small>NUMBERS</small>, properly so called,
is essential to it. For this Art undertaking to
gratify all those desires and expectations of
pleasure, that can be reasonably entertained
by us, and there being a capacity in language,
the instrument it works by, of pleasing us very
highly, not only by the sense and imagery it
conveys, but by the structure of words, and
still more by the harmonious arrangement of
them in metrical sounds or numbers, and
lastly there being no reason in the nature of
the thing itself why these pleasures should not
be united, it follows that poetry will not be
that which it professes to be, that is, not
accomplish its own purpose, unless it delight
the ear with numbers, or, in other words, unless
it be cloathed in <small>VERSE</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The reader, I dare say, has hitherto gone
along with me, in this deduction: but here, I
suspect, we shall separate. Yet he will startle
the less at this conclusion, if he reflect on the
origin and first application of poetry among all
nations.</p>

<p>It is every where of the most early growth,
preceding every other sort of composition; and
being destined for the <i>ear</i>, that is, to be either
sung, or at least recited, it adapts itself, even
in its first rude essays, to that sense of measure
and proportion in sounds, which is so natural
to us. The hearer’s attention is the sooner
gained by this means, his entertainment
quickened, and his admiration of the performer’s
art excited. Men are ambitious of
pleasing, and ingenious in refining upon what
they observe will please. So that musical cadences
and harmonious sounds, which nature
dictated, are farther softened and improved by
art, till poetry become as ravishing to the ear,
as the images, it presents, are to the imagination.
In process of time, what was at first
the extemporaneous production of genius
or passion, under the conduct of a <i>natural
ear</i>, becomes the labour of the closet,
and is conducted by artificial rules; yet still,
with a secret reference to the <i>sense</i> of hearing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and to that acceptation which melodious sounds
meet with in the recital of expressive words.</p>

<p>Even the prose-writer (when the art is
enough advanced to produce prose) having
been accustomed to have his ear consulted and
gratified by the poet, catches insensibly the
same harmonious affection, tunes his sentences
and periods to some agreement with
song, and transfers into his coolest narrative,
or gravest instruction, something of that music,
with which his ear vibrates from poetic
impressions.</p>

<p>In short, he leaves measured and determinate
numbers, that is, <span class="smcap">Metre</span>, to the poet,
who is to please up to the height of his faculties,
and the nature of his work; and only reserves
to himself, whose purpose of giving
pleasure is subordinate to another end, the
looser musical measure, or what we call
<span class="smcap">Rhythmical Prose</span>.</p>

<p>The reason appears, from this deduction,
why <i>all</i> poetry aspires to please by melodious
numbers. To <i>some</i> species, it is thought
more essential, than to others, because those
species continue to be <i>sung</i>, that is, are more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
immediately addressed to the ear; and because
they continue to be sung in concert with <i>musical
instruments</i>, by which the ear is still
more indulged. It happened in antient Greece,
that even tragedy retained this accompaniment
of musical instruments, through all its stages,
and even in its most improved state. Whence
Aristotle includes <i>Music</i>, properly so called,
as well as <i>Rhythm</i> and <i>Metre</i>, in his idea of
the tragic poem. He did this, because he
found the drama of his country, <small>OMNIBUS NUMERIS
ABSOLUTUM</small>, I mean in possession of all
the advantages which could result from the
union of <i>rhythmical</i>, <i>metrical</i>, and <i>musical</i>
sounds. Modern tragedy has relinquished
part of these: yet still, if it be true that this
poem be more pleasing by the addition of the
<i>musical</i> art, and there be nothing in the nature
of the composition which forbids the use of it,
I know not why Aristotle’s idea should not be
adopted, and his precept become a standing
law of the tragic stage. For this, as every
other poem, being calculated and designed
properly and ultimately to <i>please</i>, whatever
contributes to produce that end most perfectly,
all circumstances taken into the account, must
be thought of the nature or essence of the
kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>But without carrying matters so far, let us
confine our attention to metre, or what we call
<i>verse</i>. This must be essential to every work
bearing the name of <i>poem</i>, not, because we
are only accustomed to call works written in
verse, <i>poems</i>, but because a work, which professes
to please us by every possible and proper
method, and yet does not give us this pleasure,
which it is in its power, and is no way
improper for it, to give, must so far fall short
of fulfilling its own engagements to us; that is,
it has not all those qualities which we have a
right to expect in a work of literary art, of
which <i>pleasure</i> is the ultimate <i>end</i>.</p>

<p>To explain myself by an obvious instance.
History undertakes to <small>INSTRUCT</small> us in the
transactions of past times. If it answer this
purpose, it does all that is of <i>its nature</i>; and,
if it find means to <i>please</i> us, besides, by the
harmony of its style, and vivacity of its narration,
all this is to be accounted as pure gain:
if it instructed <small>ONLY</small>, by the truth of its
reports, and the perspicuity of its method, it
would fully attain its <i>end</i>. Poetry, on the
other hand, undertakes to <small>PLEASE</small>. If it employ
all its powers to this purpose, it effects all
that is of <i>its nature</i>: if it serve, besides, to
inform or instruct us, by the truths it conveys,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and by the precepts or examples it inculcates,
this service may rather be accepted, than required
by us: if it pleased <small>ONLY</small>, by its ingenious
fictions, and harmonious structure, it
would discharge its office, and answer its
<i>end</i>.</p>

<p>In this sense, the famous saying of Eratosthenes,
quoted above&mdash;<i>that the poet’s aim is
to please, not to instruct</i>&mdash;is to be understood:
nor does it appear, what reason Strabo
could have to take offence at it; however it
might be misapplied, as he tells us it was, by
that writer. For, though the poets, no doubt
(and especially <small>THE POET</small>, whose honour the
great Geographer would assert, in his criticism
on Eratosthenes) frequently <i>instruct us</i> by a
true and faithful representation of things; yet
even this instructive air is only assumed for the
sake of <i>pleasing</i>; which, as the human mind
is constituted, they could not so well do, if
they did not instruct at all, that is, if <i>truth</i>
were wholly neglected by them. So that <i>pleasure</i>
is still the ultimate end and <i>scope</i> of the
poet’s art; and <i>instruction</i> itself is, in his
hands, only one of the <i>means</i>, by which he
would effect it<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>I am the larger on this head to shew that it
is not a mere verbal dispute, as it is commonly
thought, whether poems should be written in
verse, or no. Men may include, or not include,
the idea of metre in their complex idea
of what they call a <i>Poem</i>. What I contend
for, is, that <i>metre</i>, as an instrument of
<i>pleasing</i>, is essential to every work of poetic
art, and would therefore enter into such idea,
if men judged of poetry according to its confessed
<i>nature and end</i>.</p>

<p>Whence it may seem a little strange, that
my Lord Bacon should speak of <i>poesy as a
part of learning in measure of words</i> <small>FOR THE
MOST PART</small> <i>restrained</i>; when his own notion,
as we have seen above, was, that the essence
of poetry consisted <i>in submitting the shews of
things to the desires of the mind</i>. For these
<i>shews of things</i> could only be exhibited to the
mind through the <i>medium of words</i>: and it is
just as natural for the mind to desire that these
words should be <i>harmonious</i>, as that the
images, conveyed in them, should, be <i>illustrious</i>;
there being a capacity in the mind of
being delighted through its organ, the <i>ear</i>, as
well as through its power, or faculty of <i>imagination</i>.
And the wonder is the greater, because
the great philosopher himself was aware
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
of the <i>agreement and consort which poetry
hath with music</i>, as well as <i>with man’s nature
and pleasure</i>, that is, with the pleasure which
naturally results from gratifying the imagination.
So that, to be consistent with himself,
he should, methinks, have said&mdash;<i>that poesy
was a part of learning in measure of words</i>
<small>ALWAYS</small> <i>restrained</i>; such <i>poesy</i>, as, through
the idleness or negligence of writers, is not so
restrained, not agreeing to his own idea of <i>this
part of learning</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.</p>

<p>These reflexions will afford a proper solution
of that question, which has been agitated
by the critics, “Whether a work of fiction
and imagination (such as that of the archbishop
of Cambray, for instance) conducted,
in other respects, according to the rules of
the epic poem, but written in prose, may
deserve the name of <span class="smcap">Poem</span>, or not.” For,
though it be frivolous indeed to dispute about
names, yet from what has been said it appears,
that if metre be not incongruous to the nature
of an epic composition, and it afford a pleasure
which is not to be found in mere prose, metre
is, for that reason, essential to this mode of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
writing; which is only saying in other words,
that an epic composition, to give all the pleasure
which it is capable of giving, must be
written in <i>verse</i>.</p>

<p>But, secondly, this conclusion, I think, extends
farther than to such works as aspire to
the name of <i>epic</i>. For instance, what are we
to think of those <i>novels</i> or <i>romances</i>, as they
are called, that is, fables constructed on some
private and familiar subject, which have been
so current, of late, through all Europe? As
they propose pleasure for their end, and prosecute
it, besides, in the way of <i>fiction</i>, though
without metrical numbers, and generally, indeed,
in harsh and rugged prose, one easily
sees what their pretensions are, and under
what idea they are ambitious to be received.
Yet, as they are wholly destitute of measured
sounds (to say nothing of their other numberless
defects) they can, at most, be considered
but as hasty, imperfect, and abortive poems;
whether spawned from the dramatic, or narrative
species, it may be hard to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unfinish’d things, one knows not what to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their generation’s so equivocal.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>However, such as they are, these <i>novelties</i>
have been generally well received: <i>Some</i>, for
the real merit of their execution; <i>Others</i>, for
their amusing subjects; <i>All</i> of them, for the
gratification they afford, or promise at least,
to a vitiated, palled, and sickly imagination&mdash;that
last disease of learned minds, and sure
prognostic of expiring Letters. But whatever
may be the temporary success of these things
(for they vanish as fast as they are produced,
and are produced as soon as they are conceived)
good sense will acknowledge no work of art
but such as is composed according to the laws
of its <i>kind</i>. These <small>KINDS</small>, as arbitrary things
as we account them (for I neither forget nor
dispute what our best philosophy teaches concerning
<i>kinds</i> and <i>sorts</i>), have yet so far their
foundation in nature and the reason of things,
that it will not be allowed us to multiply, or
vary them, at pleasure. We may, indeed,
mix and confound them, if we will (for there
is a sort of literary luxury, which would engross
all pleasures at once, even such as are
contradictory to each other), or, in our rage
for incessant gratification, we may take up
with half-formed pleasures, such as come first
to hand, and may be administered by any
body: But true taste requires chaste, severe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and simple pleasures; and true genius will only
be concerned in administering such.</p>

<p>Lastly, on the same principle on which we
have decided on these questions concerning
the <i>absolute merits</i> of poems in prose, in
<i>all</i> languages, we may, also, determine another,
which has been put concerning the
<i>comparative merits</i> of <small>RHYMED</small>, and what is
called <small>BLANK</small> verse, in our <i>own</i>, and the other
<i>modern</i> languages.</p>

<p>Critics and antiquaries have been sollicitous
to find out who were the inventors of rhyme,
which some fetch from the Monks, some from
the Goths, and others from the Arabians:
whereas, the truth seems to be, that <i>rhyme</i>,
or the consonance of final syllables, occurring
at stated intervals, is the dictate of nature, or,
as we may say, an appeal to the <i>ear</i>, in all languages,
and in some degree pleasing in all. The
difference is, that, in some languages, these consonances
are apt of themselves to occur so often
that they rather nauseate, than please, and so,
instead of being affected, are studiously avoided
by good writers; while in others, as in all the
modern ones, where these consonances are less
frequent, and where the quantity of syllables
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
is not so distinctly marked as, of itself, to afford
an harmonious measure and musical variety,
there it is of necessity that poets have
had recourse to <i>Rhyme</i>; or to some other expedient
of the like nature, such as the <i>Alliteration</i>,
for instance; which is only another
way of delighting the ear by iterated sound,
and may be defined, <i>the consonance of initial
letters</i>, as rhyme is, the <i>consonance of final
syllables</i>. All this, I say, is of necessity, because
what we call verses in such languages
will be otherwise untuneful, and will not strike
the ear with that vivacity, which is requisite
to put a sensible difference between poetic
numbers and measured prose.</p>

<p>In short, no method of gratifying the ear
by <i>measured sound</i>, which experience has
found pleasing, is to be neglected by the poet:
and although, from the different structure
and genius of languages, these methods will
be different, the studious application of such
methods, as each particular language allows,
becomes a necessary part of his office. He
will only cultivate those methods most, which
tend to produce, in a given language, the most
harmonious structure or measure, of which it
is capable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>Hence it comes to pass, that the poetry of
some modern languages cannot so much as
subsist, without rhyme: In others, it is only
embellished by it. Of the <i>former</i> sort is the
French, which therefore adopts, and with
good reason, rhymed verse, not in tragedy
only, but in comedy: And though foreigners,
who have a language differently constructed,
are apt to treat this observance of rhyme as an
idle affectation, yet it is but just to allow that
the French themselves are the most competent
judges of the natural defect of their own
tongue, and the likeliest to perceive by what
management such defect is best remedied or
concealed.</p>

<p>In the <i>latter</i> class of languages, whose
poetry is only embellished by the use of
rhyme, we may reckon the Italian and the
English: which being naturally more tuneful
and harmonious than the French, may afford
all the melody of sound which is expected in
some sorts of poetry, by its <i>varied pause</i>, and
<i>quantity</i> only; while in other sorts, which are
more sollicitous to please the ear, and where
such solicitude, if taken notice of by the
reader or hearer, is not resented, it may be
proper, or rather it becomes a law of the English
and Italian poetry, to adopt <i>rhyme</i>. Thus,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
our tragedies are usually composed in blank
verse: but our epic and Lyric compositions
are found most pleasing, when cloathed in
rhyme. Milton, I know, it will be said, is
an exception: But, if we set aside some
learned persons, who have suffered themselves
to be too easily prejudiced by their admiration
of the Greek and Latin languages, and still
more, perhaps, by the prevailing notion of the
monkish or gothic original of rhymed verse,
all other readers, if left to themselves, would,
I dare say, be more delighted with this poet,
if, besides his various pause, and measured
quantity, he had enriched his numbers, with
<i>rhyme</i>. So that his love of liberty, the ruling
passion of his heart, perhaps transported him
too far, when he chose to follow the example
set him by one or two writers of <i>prime note</i>
(to use his own eulogium), rather than comply
with the regular and prevailing practice of his
favoured Italy, which first and principally, as
our best rhymist sings,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pauses, cadence, and well-vowell’d words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the graces a good ear affords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Made rhyme an art</span>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Our comedy, indeed, is generally written
in <i>prose</i>; but through the idleness, or ill taste,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
of our writers, rather than from any other just
cause. For, though rhyme be not necessary,
or rather would be improper, in the comedy
of our language, which can support itself in
poetic numbers, without the diligence of
rhyme; yet some sort of metre is requisite in
this humbler species of poem; otherwise, it
will not contribute all that is within its power
and province, to <i>please</i>. And the particular
metre, proper for this species, is not far to
seek. For it can plainly be no other than a
careless and looser Iambic, such as our language
naturally runs into, even in conversation,
and of which we are not without examples, in
our old and best writers for the comic stage.
But it is not wonderful that those critics, who
take offence at English epic poems in <i>rhyme</i>,
because the Greek and Latin only observed
<i>quantity</i>, should require English comedies to
be written in <i>prose</i>, though the Greek and
Latin comedies were composed in <i>verse</i>. For
the ill application of examples, and the neglect
of them, may be well enough expected from
the same men, since it does not appear that
their judgment was employed, or the reason
of the thing attended to, in either instance.</p>

<p>And <small>THUS</small> much for the idea of <span class="smcap">Universal
Poetry</span>. It is the art of treating any subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in <i>such</i> a way as is found most delightful to
us; that is, <small>IN AN ORNAMENTED AND NUMEROUS
STYLE&mdash;IN THE WAY OF FICTION&mdash;AND IN
VERSE</small>. Whatever deserves the name of <small>POEM</small>
must unite these three properties; only in different
degrees of each, according to its nature.
For the art of every <i>kind</i> of poetry is only this
general art so modified as the <i>nature</i> of each,
that is, its more immediate and subordinate
end, may respectively require.</p>

<p>We are now, then, at the well-head of the
poetic art; and they who drink deeply of this
spring, will be best qualified to perform the
rest. But all heads are not equal to these copious
draughts; and, besides, I hear the sober
reader admonishing me long since&mdash;</p>

<h2 id="DISSERTATION_II">DISSERTATION II.<br />

<small>ON THE</small><br />

PROVINCES OF THE DRAMA.</h2>

<p>In the former Essay, I gave an idea, or slight
sketch, of <i>Universal Poetry</i>. In this, I attempt
to deduce the laws of one of its kinds,
the <i>Dramatic</i>, under all its forms. And I
engage in this task, the rather, because, though
much has been said on the subject of the
drama, writers seem not to have taken sufficient
pains to distinguish, with exactness, its
several species.</p>

<p>I deduce the laws of this poem, as I did
those of poetry at large, from the consideration
of its <i>end</i>: not the general end of poetry,
which alone was proper to be considered
the former case, but the proximate end of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
this kind. For from these ends, in subordination
to that, which governs the genus, or
which all poetry, as such, designs and prosecutes,
are the peculiar rules and maxims of
each species to be derived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The purpose of the Drama</span> is, universally,
“to represent human life in the way of
<i>action</i>.” But as such representation it made
for separate and distinct <small>ENDS</small>, it is, further,
distinguished into different <i>species</i>, which we
know by the names of <span class="smcap">Tragedy</span>, <span class="smcap">Comedy</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Farce</span>.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Tragedy</span>, then, I mean that species
of dramatic representation, whose <i>end</i> is
“<i>to excite the passions of</i> <small>PITY</small> <i>and</i> <small>TERROR</small>,
<i>and perhaps some others, nearly allied to
them</i>.”</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Comedy</span> <i>that</i>, which proposeth, for the
<i>ends</i> of its representation, “<i>the sensation of
pleasure arising from a view of the truth of</i>
<small>CHARACTERS</small>, <i>more especially their specific
differences</i>.”</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Farce</span> I understand, that species of the
drama, “<i>whose sole aim and tendency is to
excite</i> <small>LAUGHTER</small>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>The idea of these <i>three species</i> being then
proposed, let us now see, what conclusions
may be drawn from it. And chiefly in respect
of <i>Tragedy</i> and <i>Comedy</i>, which are most
important. For as to what concerns the
province of <i>Farce</i>, this will be easily understood,
when the character of the other two
is once settled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_I">CHAP. I.<br />

<span class="medium">ON THE PROVINCES OF TRAGEDY AND
COMEDY.</span></h2>

<p>From the idea of these two species, as
given above, the following conclusions, about
the <i>natures</i> of each, are immediately deducible.</p>

<p>1. If the proper end of <small>TRAGEDY</small> be to <i>affect</i>,
it follows, “that <i>actions</i>, not characters,
are the chief object of its representations.”
For that which <i>affects</i> us most in the view of
human life is the observation of those signal
circumstances of <i>felicity or distress</i>, which
occur in the fortunes of men. But <i>felicity</i>
and <i>distress</i>, as the great critic takes notice,
depend on <i>action</i>; κατὰ τὰς πράξεις, εὐδαίμονες,
ἢ τουναντίον. They are then the calamitous
<i>events</i>, or fortunate <i>Issues</i> in human action,
which stir up the stronger <i>affections</i>, and agitate
the heart with <i>Passion</i>. The <i>manners</i>
are not, indeed, to be neglected. But they
become an inferior consideration in the views
of the tragic poet, and are exhibited only for
the sake of making the <i>action</i> more proper to
interest us. Thus our <i>joy</i>, on the <i>happy</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
<i>catastrophe</i> of the fable, depends, in a good
degree, on the <i>virtuous character</i> of the
agent; as on the other hand, we sympathize
more strongly with him, on a <i>distressful issue</i>.
The <i>manners</i> of the several persons in the
drama must, also, be signified, that the <i>action</i>,
which in many cases will be determined
by them, may appear to be carried on with
<i>truth and probability</i>. Hence every thing
passing before us, as we are accustomed to see
it in real life, we enter more warmly into their
interests, as forgetting, that we are attentive
to a <i>fictitious scene</i>. And, besides, from
knowing the personal <i>good, or ill, qualities</i>
of the agents, we learn to anticipate their future
<i>felicity</i> or <i>misery</i>, which gives increase
to the <i>passion</i> in either case. Our acquaintance
with <span class="smcap">Iago’s</span> <i>close villainy</i> makes us
tremble for Othello and Desdemona beforehand:
and <span class="smcap">Hamlet’s</span> <i>filial piety and intrepid
daring</i> occasion the audience secretly to exult
in the <i>expectation</i> of some successful vengeance
to be inflicted on the incestuous murderers.</p>

<p>2. For the same reason as tragedy takes for
its <i>object</i> the actions of men, it, also, prefers,
or rather confines itself to, such actions, as
are most <i>important</i>. Which is only saying,
that as it intends to <i>interest</i>, it, of course,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
chuses the representation of those <i>events</i>,
which are most <i>interesting</i>.</p>

<p>And this shews the defect of modern tragedy,
in turning so constantly as it does, on
<i>love subjects</i>; the effect of this practice is,
that, excepting only the rank of the actors
(which indeed, as will be seen presently, is of
considerable importance), the rest is below the
dignity of this drama. For the <i>action</i>, when
stripped of its accidental ornaments and reduced
to the <i>essential fact</i>, is nothing more
than what might as well have passed in a cottage,
as a king’s palace. The Greek poets
should be our guides here, who take the very
grandest events in their story to ennoble their
tragedy. Whence it comes to pass that the
<i>action</i>, having an essential dignity, is always
<i>interesting</i>, and by the simplest management
of the poet becomes in a supreme degree,
<i>pathetic</i>.</p>

<p>3. On the same account, the <i>persons</i>, whose
actions Tragedy would exhibit to us, must be
of <i>principal rank and dignity</i>. For the actions
of these are, both in <i>themselves</i> and in
their <i>consequences</i>, most fitted to excite passion.
The <i>distresses</i> of private and inferior
persons will, no doubt, <i>affect</i> us greatly; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
we may give the name of <i>tragedies</i>, if we
please, to dramatic representations of them:
as, in fact, we have several applauded pieces
of this kind. Nay, it may seem, that the fortunes
of private men, as more nearly resembling
<i>those</i> of the generality, should be
most <i>affecting</i>. But this circumstance, in no
degree, makes amends for the loss of other and
much greater <i>advantages</i>. For, whatever be
the <i>unhappy incidents</i> in the story of private
men, it is certain, they must take faster hold
of the <i>imagination</i>, and, of course, impress
the heart more forcibly, when related of the
higher characters in life.</p>

<p>Kings, Heroes, Statesmen, and other persons
of great and public authority, influence by
their <i>ill-fortune</i> the whole community, to
which they belong. The attention is rouzed,
and all our faculties take an alarm, at the apprehension
of such extensive and important
wretchedness. And, besides, if we regard the
<i>event</i> itself, without an eye to its <i>effects</i>, there
is still the widest difference between the two
cases. Those ideas of awe and veneration,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
which opinion throws round the persons of
princes, make us esteem the very <i>same event</i>
in their fortunes, as more august and emphatical,
than in the fortunes of private men. In
the <i>one</i>, it is ordinary and familiar to our conceptions;
it is singular and surprizing, in the
<i>other</i>. The fall of a <i>cottage</i>, by the accidents
of time and weather, is almost unheeded;
while the ruin of a <i>tower</i>, which the neighbourhood
hath gazed at for ages with admiration,
strikes all observers with concern. So
that if we chuse to continue the absurdity,
taken notice of in the last article of planning
<i>unimportant action</i> in our tragedy, we should,
at least, take care to give it this foreign and
extrinsic <i>importance</i> of great <i>actors</i>: Yet our
passion for the <i>familiar</i> goes so far, that we
have tragedies, not only of private action, but
of <i>private persons</i>; and so have well nigh annihilated
the noblest of the two dramas
amongst us. On the whole it appears, that
as the proper object or tragedy is <i>action</i>, so it
is <i>important</i> action, and therefore more especially
the action of <i>great and illustrious men</i>.
Each of these conclusions is the direct consequence
of our idea of its <i>end</i>.</p>

<p>The reverse of all this holds true of <small>COMEDY</small>.
For,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>1. Comedy, by the very terms of the definition,
is conversant about <i>characters</i>. And
if we observe, that which creates the pleasure
we find in contemplating the lives of men,
considered as distinct from the <i>interest</i> we take
in their fortunes, is the contemplation of their
manners and humours. Their <i>actions</i>, when
they are not of that sort, which seizes our admiration,
or catches the affections, are not
otherwise considered by us, than as they are
sensible indications of the internal sentiment
and disposition. Our intimate consciousness
of the several turns and windings of our nature,
makes us attend to these pictures of human
life with an incredible curiosity. And herein
the proper entertainment, which comic representation,
<i>as such</i>, administers to the mind,
consists. By turning the thought on <i>event
and action</i>, this entertainment is proportionably
lessened; that is, the <i>end</i> of comedy is
less perfectly attained<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>But here, again, though <i>action</i> be not the
main object of comedy, yet it is not to be neglected,
any more than <i>character</i> in tragedy,
but comes in as an useful accessary, or assistant
to it. For the <i>manners of men</i> only shew
themselves, or shew themselves most usually,
in <i>action</i>. It is this, which fetches out the
latent strokes of <i>character</i>, and renders the
inward <i>temper and disposition</i> the object of
sense. <i>Probable circumstances</i> are then imagined,
and a certain <i>train of action</i> contrived,
to evidence the <i>internal qualities</i>. There is
no <i>other</i>, or no <i>probable</i> way, but this, of
bringing us acquainted with them. Again;
by engaging his <i>characters</i> in a course of action
and the pursuit of some <i>end</i>, the comic poet
leaves them to express themselves undisguisedly,
and <i>without design</i>; in which the essence of
<i>humour</i> consists.</p>

<p>Add to this, that when the <i>fable</i> is so contrived
as to attach the mind, we very naturally
fancy ourselves present at a course of <i>living</i>
action. And this illusion quickens our attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
to the <i>characters</i>, which no longer appear
to us creatures of the poet’s fiction, but
actors in real life.</p>

<p>These observations concerning the <i>moderated</i>
use of action in comedy, instruct us
what to think “of those intricate Spanish plots,
which have been in use, and have taken both
with us and some French writers for the
stage. The truth is, they have hindered
very much the main end of comedy. For
when these unnatural plots are used, the
mind is not only entirely <i>drawn off</i> from
the characters by those surprizing turns and
revolutions; but characters have no opportunity
even of being <i>called out</i> and displaying
themselves. For the actors of all characters
<i>succeed</i> and are <i>embarrassed</i> alike, when the
instruments for carrying on designs are only
<i>perplexed apartments</i>, <i>dark entries</i>, <i>disguised
habits</i>, and <i>ladders of ropes</i>. The
comic plot is, and must, indeed, be carried
on by <i>deceipt</i>. The Spanish scene does it
by deceiving the man <i>through his senses</i>: Terence
and Moliere, by deceiving him <i>through
his passions and affections</i>. This is the
right method: for the character is <i>not</i> called
out under the <i>first</i> species of deceipt: under
the <i>second</i>, the character does <i>all</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>2. As <i>character</i>, not <i>action</i>, is the object
of comedy; so the <i>characters</i> it paints must
not be of <i>singular and illustrious note</i>, either
for their <i>virtues</i> or <i>vices</i>. The reason is, that
such characters take too fast hold of the <i>affections</i>,
and so call off the mind from adverting
to the <i>truth</i> of the manners; that is, from receiving
the <i>pleasure</i>, which this poem <i>intends</i>.
Our <i>sense of imitation</i> is that to which the
comic poet addresses himself; but such pictures
of <i>eminent worth</i> or <i>villainy</i> seize upon
the <i>moral sense</i>; and by raising the strong
correspondent passions of <i>admiration</i> and <i>abhorrence</i>,
turn us aside from contemplating
the <i>imitation itself</i>. And,</p>

<p>3. For a like cause, comedy confines its
views to the characters of <i>private and inferior
persons</i>. For the <i>truth of character</i>, which
is the spring of <i>humour</i>, being necessarily, as
was observed, to be shewn through the medium
of <i>action</i>, and the actions of the great being
usually such as excite the <i>pathos</i>, it follows of
course, that these cannot, with propriety, be
made the actors in comedy. Persons of high
and public life, if they are drawn agreeably to
our accustomed ideas of them, must be employed
in such a <i>course of action</i>, as arrests
the attention, or interests the passions; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
either way it diverts the mind from observing
the <i>truth</i> of manners, that is, it prevents the
attainment of the specific <i>end</i>, which comedy
designs.</p>

<p>And if the reason, here given, be sufficient
to exclude the <i>higher characters</i> in life from
this <i>drama</i>, even where the representation is
intended to be <i>serious</i>, we shall find it still
more improper to expose them in any pleasant
or ridiculous light. ’Tis true, the follies and
foibles of the great will apparently take an
easier ridicule by representation, than those of
their inferiors. And this it was, which misled
the celebrated <span class="smcap">P. Corneille</span> into the opinion,
<i>that the actions of the great, and even of
kings themselves, provided they be of the ridiculous
kind, are as fit objects of comedy, as
any other</i>. But he did not reflect, that the
<i>actions</i> of the great being usually such, as interest
the intire community, at least scarcely
any other falling beneath vulgar notice; and
the higher <i>characters</i> being rarely seen or
contemplated by the people but with reverence,
hence it is, that in fact, <i>the representation of
high life</i> cannot, without offence to probability,
be made <i>ridiculous</i>, or consequently be
admitted into comedy under this view. And
therefore <span class="smcap">Plautus</span>, when he thought fit to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
introduce these reverend personages on the
comic stage in his <span class="smcap">Amphitruo</span>, though he employed
them in no very serious matters, was
yet obliged to apologize for this impropriety in
calling his play a <i>Tragicomedy</i>. What he
says upon the occasion, though delivered with
an air of pleasantry, is according to the laws of
just criticism.</p>

<p>And now, taking the <i>idea</i> of the <i>two dramas</i>,
as here opened, along with us, we shall be
able to give an account of several attributes,
<i>common</i> to both, or which further <i>characterize</i>
each of them. And,</p>

<p>1. <i>A plot will be required in both.</i> For the
end of tragedy being to excite the affections <i>by</i>
action, and the end of comedy, to manifest the
truth of character <i>through</i> it, an artful <i>constitution
of the Fable</i> is required to do justice
both to the one and the other. It serves to
bring out the <i>pathos</i>, and to produce <i>humour</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
And thus the general form or structure of the
two dramas will be one and the same.</p>

<p>2. More particularly, <i>an unity and even
simplicity in the conduct of the fable<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> is a
perfection in each</i>. For the course of the
<i>affections</i> is diverted and weakened by the intervention
of what we call a <i>double plot</i>; and
even by a multiplicity of <i>subordinate events</i>,
though tending to a common <i>end</i>; and, of
<i>persons</i>, though all of them, some way, concerned
in promoting it. The like consideration
shews the observance of this <i>rule</i> to be essential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
to just comedy. For when the <i>attention</i>
is split on so many interfering objects, we are
not at leisure to observe, nor do we so fully
enter into, the <i>truth of representation</i> in any
of them; the <i>sense of humour</i>, as of the <i>pathos</i>,
depending very much on the continued and
undiverted operation of its <i>object</i> upon us.</p>

<p>3. The two dramas agree, also, in this circumstance;
that the <i>manners</i> of the persons
exhibited should be <i>imperfect</i>. An absolutely
good, or an absolutely bad, character is foreign
to the purpose of each. And the reason
is, 1, That such a representation is <i>improbable</i>.
And <i>probability</i> constitutes, as we have seen,
the very essence of comedy; and is the <i>medium</i>,
through which tragedy is enabled most
powerfully to affect us. 2. Such <i>characters</i>
are improper to <i>comedy</i>, because, as was hinted
above, they turn the attention aside from contemplating
the <i>expression</i> of them, which we
call <i>humour</i>. And they are not less unsuited
to <i>tragedy</i>, because though they make a forcible
impression on the mind, yet, as Aristotle
well observes, they do not produce the passions
of <i>pity and terror</i>; that is, their <i>impressions</i>
are not of the nature of that <i>pathos</i>, by which
tragedy works its purpose. [κ. ίγ.]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>There are, likewise, some peculiarities, which
distinguish the two dramas. And</p>

<p>1. <i>Though a plot be necessary to produce</i>
humour, <i>as well as the pathos, yet a</i> good
plot <i>is not so essential to comedy, as tragedy</i>.
For the pathos is the result of the <i>entire action</i>;
that is, of all the circumstances of the story
taken together, and conspiring by a probable
tendency, to a completion in the <i>event</i>. A
failure in the just arrangement and disposition
of the parts may, then, affect what is of the
essence of this drama. On the contrary, <i>humour</i>,
though brought out by <i>action</i>, is not
the effect of the <i>whole</i>, but may be distinctly
evidenced in a <i>single scene</i>; as may be eminently
illustrated in the two comedies of
Fletcher, called <i>The Little French Lawyer</i>,
and <i>The Spanish Curate</i>. The nice contexture
of the fable therefore, though it may give
<i>pleasure</i> of another kind, is not so immediately
required to the production of <i>that</i>
pleasure, which the nature of comedy demands.
Much less is there occasion for that
labour and ingenuity of contrivance, which is
seen in the intricacy of the Spanish fable. Yet
this is the taste of our comedy. Our writers
are all for plot and intrigue; and never appear
so well satisfied with themselves as when, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
speak in their own phrase, they contrive to have
a great deal of <i>business</i> on their hands. Indeed
they have reason. For it hides their inability
to colour <i>manners</i>, which is the proper but
much harder province of true comedy.</p>

<p>2. <i>Tragedy succeeds best, when the subject
is</i> real; <i>comedy, when it is</i> feigned. What
would this say, but that tragedy, turning our
attention principally on the <i>action represented</i>,
finds means to <i>interest</i> us more strongly on
the persuasion of its being taken from <i>actual
life</i>? While comedy, on the other hand, can
neglect these scrupulous measures of <i>probability</i>,
as intent only on exhibiting <i>characters</i>; for
which purpose an <i>invented story</i> will serve
much better. The reason is, <i>real action</i> does
not ordinarily afford variety of incidents enough
to shew the <i>character</i> fully: <i>feigned action</i>
may.</p>

<p>And this difference, we may observe, explains
the reason why tragedies are often
formed on the most <i>trite and vulgar subjects</i>,
whereas a <i>new</i> subject is generally demanded
in comedy. The <i>reality</i> of the story being of
so much consequence to interest the affections,
the more <i>known</i> it is, the fitter for the poet’s
purpose. But a <i>feigned</i> story having been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
found more convenient for the display of characters,
it grew into a rule that the story
should be always <i>new</i>. This disadvantage on
the side of the comic poet is taken notice of in
those verses of Antiphanes, or rather, as Casaubon
conjectures, of <i>Aristophanes</i>, in a play
of his intitled, Ποίησις. The reason of this
difference now appears.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>One sees, then, the reason why Tragedy
prefers real <i>subjects</i>, and even old ones; and,
on the contrary, why comedy delights in
feigned subjects, and new.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>The same genius in the two dramas is observable,
in their draught of <i>characters</i>. Comedy
makes all its Characters <i>general</i>; Tragedy,
<i>particular</i>. The <i>Avare</i> of Moliere is
not so properly the picture of a <i>covetous man</i>,
as of <i>covetousness</i> itself. Racine’s <i>Nero</i>, on
the other hand, is not a picture of <i>cruelty</i>, but
of a <i>cruel man</i>.</p>

<p>Yet here it will be proper to guard against
two mistakes, which the principles now delivered
may be thought to countenance.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> is with regard to <i>tragic</i> characters,
which I say are <i>particular</i>. My meaning is,
they are <i>more</i> particular than those of comedy.
That is, the <i>end</i> of tragedy does not require or
permit the poet to draw together so many of
those characteristic circumstances which shew
the manners, as Comedy. For, in the former
of these dramas, no more of <i>character</i> is
shewn, than what the course of the action necessarily
calls forth. Whereas, all or most of
the features, by which it is usually distinguished,
are sought out and industriously
displayed in the <i>latter</i>.</p>

<p>The case is much the same as in <i>portrait
painting</i>; where, if a great master be required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
to draw a <i>particular face</i>, he gives the very
lineaments he finds in it; yet so far resembling
to what he observes of the same turn in other
faces, as not to affect any minute circumstance
of peculiarity. But if the same artist were to
design a <i>head</i> in general, he would assemble
together all the customary traits and features,
any where observable through the species,
which should best express the idea, whatever
it was, he had conceived in his own mind and
wanted to exhibit in the picture.</p>

<p>There is much the same difference between
the two sorts of <i>dramatic</i> portraits. Whence
it appears that in calling the tragic character
<i>particular</i>, I suppose it only <i>less representative</i>
of the kind than the comic; not that the
draught of so much character as it is concerned
to represent should not be <i>general</i>: the contrary
of which I have asserted and explained at
large elsewhere [<i>Notes on the A. P.</i> v. 317.]</p>

<p><i>Next</i>, I have said, the characters of just
comedy are <i>general</i>. And this I explain by
the instance of the <i>Avare</i> of Moliere, which
conforms more to the idea of <i>avarice</i>, than to
that of the real <i>avaricious man</i>. But here
again, the reader will not understand me, as
saying this in the strict sense of the words. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
even think Moliere faulty in the instance given;
though, with some necessary explanation, it
may well enough serve to express my meaning.</p>

<p>The view of the comic scene being to delineate
characters, this end, I suppose, will be
attained most perfectly, by making those characters
as <i>universal</i> as possible. For thus the
person shewn in the drama being the representative
of all characters of the same kind,
furnishes in the highest degree the entertainment
of <i>humour</i>. But then this universality
must be such as agrees not to our idea of the
<i>possible</i> effects of the character as conceived in
the abstract, but to the <i>actual</i> exertion of its
powers; which experience justifies, and common
life allows. Moliere, and before him
Plautus, had offended in this; that for a picture
of the <i>avaricious man</i>, they presented us
with a fantastic unpleasing draught of the
<i>passion of avarice</i>. I call this a <i>fantastic</i>
draught, because it hath no archetype in nature.
And it is, farther, an <i>unpleasing</i> one,
for, being the delineation of a <i>simple passion
unmixed</i>, it wanted all those</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;Lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives all the strength and colour of our life.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>These <i>lights and shades</i> (as the poet finely
calls the intermixture of many passions, which,
with the <i>leading</i> or principal one, form the
human character) must be blended together in
every picture of dramatic manners; because
the avowed business of the drama is to image
real life. Yet the draught of the <i>leading</i> passion
must be as general as this <i>strife</i> in nature
permits, in order to express the intended character
more perfectly.</p>

<p>All which again is easily illustrated in the
instance of painting. In <i>portraits of character</i>,
as we may call those that give a picture
of the <i>manners</i>, the artist, if he be of real
ability, will not go to work on the possibility
of an abstract idea. All he intends, is to shew
that some one quality <i>predominates</i>: and this
he images strongly, and by such signatures as
are most conspicuous in the operation of the
<i>leading passion</i>. And when he hath done
this, we may, in common speech or in compliment,
if we please, to his art, say of such a
portrait that it images to us not the <i>man</i> but
the <i>passion</i>; just as the ancients observed of
the famous statue of Apollodorus by Silarion,
that it expressed not the angry <i>Apollodorus</i>,
but his passion of <i>anger</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>. But by this must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
be understood only that he has well expressed
the leading parts of the designed character.
For the rest he treats his <i>subject</i> as he would
any other; that is, he represents the <i>concomitant
affections</i>, or considers merely that general
symmetry and proportion which are expected
in a human figure. And this is to copy
nature, which affords no specimen of a man
turned all into a single passion. No metamorphosis
could be more strange or incredible.
Yet portraits of this vicious taste are the admiration
of common starers, who, if they find
a picture of a <i>miser</i> for instance (as there is no
commoner subject of moral portraits) in a collection,
where every muscle is strained, and
feature hardened into the expression of this
idea, never fail to profess their wonder and
approbation of it.&mdash;On this idea of excellence
Le Brun’s book of the <span class="smcap">Passions</span> must be said
to contain a set of the justest <i>moral portraits</i>:
And the <span class="smcap">Characters</span> of Theophrastus might
be recommended, in a <i>dramatic</i> view, as preferable
to those of Terence.</p>

<p>The virtuosi in the fine arts would certainly
laugh at the former of these judgments. But
the latter, I suspect, will not be thought so
extraordinary. At least if one may guess from
the practice of some of our best comic writers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and the success which such plays have commonly
met with. It were easy to instance in
almost all plays of character. But if the reader
would see the extravagance of building dramatic
manners on abstract ideas, in its full
light, he needs only turn to B. Jonson’s
<i>Every man out of his humour</i>; which under
the name of a <i>play of character</i> is in fact, an
unnatural, and, as the painters call it, <i>hard</i>
delineation of a group of <i>simply existing passions</i>,
wholly chimerical, and unlike to any
thing we observe in the commerce of real life.
Yet this comedy has always had its admirers.
And <i>Randolph</i>, in particular, was so taken
with the design, that he seems to have formed
his <i>muse’s looking-glass</i> in express imitation
of it.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, we may observe, is in this as
in all the other more essential beauties of the
drama, a perfect model. If the discerning
reader peruse attentively his comedies with
this view, he will find his <i>best-marked</i> characters
discoursing through a great deal of their
<i>parts</i>, just like any other, and only expressing
their essential and leading qualities occasionally,
and as circumstances concur to give an easy
exposition to them. This singular excellence
of his comedy, was the effect of his copying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
faithfully after nature, and of the force and vivacity
of his genius, which made him attentive
to what the progress of the scene successively
presented to him: whilst <i>imitation</i> and <i>inferior
talents</i> occasion little writers to wind
themselves up into the habit of attending perpetually
to their main view, and a solicitude
to keep their favourite characters in constant
play and agitation. Though in this illiberal
exercise of their wit, they may be said to use
the <i>persons of the drama</i> as a certain facetious
sort do their <i>acquaintance</i>, whom they urge
and teize with their civilities, not to give them
a reasonable share in the conversation, but to
force them to play <i>tricks</i> for the diversion of
the company.</p>

<p>I have been the longer on this argument, to
prevent the reader’s carrying what I say of the
superiority of <i>plays of character</i> to <i>plays of
intrigue</i> into an extreme; a mistake, into
which some good writers have been unsuspectingly
betrayed by the acknowledged truth
of the general principle. It is so natural for
men on all occasions, to fly out into extremes,
that too much care cannot be had to retain
them in a due medium. But to return from
the digression to the consideration of the
difference of the two dramas.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>3. A sameness of <i>character is not usually
objected to in tragedy: in comedy, it would
not be endured</i>. The passion of <i>avarice</i>, to
resume the instance given above, being the
main object, we find nothing but a disgustful
repetition in a second attempt to delineate that
<i>character</i>. <i>A particular cruel man</i> only engrossing
our regard in <i>Nero</i>, when the train of
events evidencing such cruelty is changed, we
have all the novelty we look for, and can contemplate,
with pleasure, the very <i>same</i> character,
set forth by a different course of action,
or displayed in some other <i>person</i>.</p>

<p>4. Comedy succeeds best when the scene is
laid <i>at home</i>, tragedy for the most part when
<i>abroad</i>. “This appears at first sight whimsical
and capricious, but has its foundation
in nature. What we chiefly seek in comedy
is a true image of life and <i>manners</i>, but we
are not easily brought to think we have it
given us, when dressed in foreign modes and
fashions. And yet a good writer must follow
his scene, and observe decorum. On the
contrary, ’tis the action in tragedy which
most engages our attention. But to fit a
domestic occurrence for the stage, we must
take greater liberties with the action than a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
well-known story will allow.” [<i>Pope’s
Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 185.]</p>

<p>Other <i>characters</i> of the two dramas, as well
<i>peculiar</i>, as <i>common</i>, which might be accounted for
from the just notion of them, delivered
above, I leave to the observation of the
reader. For my intention is not to write a
complete treatise on the drama, but briefly to
lay down such principles, from whence its <i>laws</i>
may be derived.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.<br />

<span class="medium">OF THE GENIUS OF COMEDY.</span></h2>

<p>But it may not be amiss to express myself
a little more fully as to the <i>genius</i> of comedy;
which for want of passing through the hands
of such a critic as Aristotle, has been less
perfectly understood.</p>

<p>Its <i>end</i> is the production of <i>humour</i>: or
which comes to the same thing, “of that
<i>pleasure</i>, which the <i>truth</i> of representation
affords, in the <i>exhibition</i> of the <i>private characters</i>
of life, more particularly their <i>specific
differences</i>.” I add this <i>latter</i> clause,
because the principal pleasure we take in contemplating
characters consists in noting those
<i>differences</i>. The general attributes of humanity,
if represented ever so truly, give us but
a slender entertainment. They, of course,
make a part of the drama; but we chiefly delight
in a picture of those peculiar <i>traits</i>,
which distinguish the species. Now these
discriminating marks in the characters of men
are not <i>necessarily</i> the causes of ridicule, or
pleasantry of any kind; but <i>accidentally</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
according to the nature or quality of them.
The vanity, and impertinent boasting of
<i>Thraso</i> is the natural object of <i>contempt</i>, and,
when truly and forcibly expressed in his own
character, provokes <i>ridicule</i>. The easy humanity
of <i>Mitio</i>, which is the leading part of
his character, is the object of <i>approbation</i>;
and, when shewn in his own conduct, excites
a <i>pleasure</i>, in common with all just <i>expression
of the manners</i>, but of a <i>serious</i> nature, as
being joined with the sentiment of <i>esteem</i>.</p>

<p>But now as most men find a greater pleasure
in gratifying the passion of <i>contempt</i>, than the
calm instinct of <i>approbation</i>, and since perhaps
the constitution of human life is such, as
affords more exercise for the one, than the
other, hence it hath come to pass, that the
comic poet, who paints for the generality, and
follows nature, chuses more commonly to select
and describe those <i>peculiarities</i> in the
human character, which, by their nature, excite
<i>pleasantry</i>, than such as create a serious
regard and esteem. Hence some persons have
appropriated the name of <i>comedies</i> to those
dramas, which chiefly aim at producing <i>humour</i>,
in the more <i>proper</i> sense of the word;
under which view it means
such an expression
or picture of what is odd, or inordinate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
in each character, as gives us the
fullest and strongest image of the original,
and by the truth of the representation exposes
the <i>ridicule</i> of it.” And it is certain,
that comedy receives great advantage from representations
of this kind. Nay, it cannot
well subsist without them. Yet it doth not
exclude the other and more <i>serious</i> entertainment,
which, as it stands on the same foundation
of <i>truth of representation</i>, I venture to
include under the <i>common term</i>.</p>

<p>Further, there are <i>two ways</i> of evidencing
the characteristic and predominant qualities of
men, or, of producing <i>humour</i>, which require
to be observed. The <i>one</i> is, when they are
shewn in the perpetual course and tenor of the
representation; that is, when the <i>humour</i> results
from the <i>general</i> conduct of the person
in the drama, and the discourse, which he
holds in it. The <i>other</i> is, when by an happy
and lively stroke, the characteristic quality is
laid open and exposed <i>at once</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> sort of <i>humour</i> is that which we
find in the ancients, and especially Terence.
The <i>latter</i> is almost peculiar to the moderns;
who, in uniting these two species of <i>humour</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
have brought a vast improvement to the comic
scene. The reason of this difference may perhaps
have been the singular simplicity of the
old writers, who were contented to take up
with such sentiments or circumstances, as
most naturally and readily occurred in the
course of the drama: whereas the moderns
have been ambitious to shew a more exquisite
and studied investigation into the workings of
human nature, and have sought out for those
peculiarly striking lineaments, in which the
essence of character consists. On the same
account, I suppose, it was that the ancients
had <i>fewer</i> characters in their plays, than the
moderns, and those more <i>general</i>; that is,
their dramatic writers were well satisfied with
picturing the most <i>usual</i> personages, and in
their most <i>obvious</i> lights. They did not, as
the moderns (who, if they would aspire to the
praise of <i>novelty</i>, were obliged to this route),
cast about for less <i>familiar</i> characters; and the
nicer and <i>less observed</i> peculiarities which distinguish
<i>each</i>. Be it as it will, the observation
is certain. Later dramatists have apparently
shewn a more accurate knowledge of human
life: and, by opening these new and untryed
veins of <i>humour</i>, have exceedingly enriched
the comedy of our times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>But, though we are not to look for the <i>two
species of humour</i>, before-mentioned, in the
same perfection on the simpler stages of <i>Greece
and Rome</i>, as in <i>our</i> improved Theatres, yet
the <i>first</i> of them was clearly seen and successfully
practised by the ancient comic masters;
and there are not wanting in them some few
examples even of the <i>last</i>. “The old man in
the <i>Mother-in-Law</i> says to his Son,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tum tu igitur nihil adtulisti huc plus un&acirc; sententi&acirc;.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, as an excellent person observed to me,
is true <i>humour</i>. For his character, which
was that of a lover of money, drew the observation
naturally and forcibly from him.
His disappointment of a rich succession made
him speak contemptibly of a moral lesson,
which rich and covetous men, in their best
humours, have no high reverence for. And
this too without <i>design</i>; which is important,
and shews the distinction of what, in the
more restrained sense of the word, we call
<i>humour</i>, from other modes of <i>pleasantry</i>.
For had a young friend of the son, an unconcerned
spectator of the scene, made the
observation, it had then, in another’s mouth,
been <i>wit</i>, or a designed <i>banter</i> on the father’s
disappointment. As, on the other hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
when such characteristic qualities are exaggerated,
and the expression of them stretched
beyond <i>truth</i>, they become <i>buffoonry</i>, even
in the person’s <i>own</i>.”</p>

<p>This is an instance of the <i>second species</i> of
humour, under its idea of exciting <i>ridicule</i>.
But it may, also, be employed with the utmost
<i>seriousness</i>; as being only a method of
expressing the <i>truth</i> of character in the <i>most
striking</i> manner. This same <i>old man</i> in the
Hecyra will furnish an example. Though a
lover of money, he appears, in the main, of
an honest and worthy nature, and to have
born the truest affection to an amiable and favourite
son. In the perplexity of the scene,
which had arisen from the supposed misunderstanding
between his <i>son’s</i> wife and his <i>own</i>,
he proposes, as an expedient to end all differences,
to retire with his wife into the country.
And to enforce this proposal to the young
man, who had his reasons for being against it,
he adds,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6"><i>odiosa est haec aetas adolescentulis:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>E medio aequum excedere est: postrem&ograve; nos jam fabula</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sumus, Pamphile, senex atque anus</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is nothing, I suppose in these words,
which provokes a smile. Yet the <i>humour</i> is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
strong, as before. In his solicitude to promote
his son’s satisfaction, he lets fall a sentiment
truly characteristic, and which old men usually
take great pains to conceal; I mean, his acknowledgment
of <i>that suspicious fear of contempt,
which is natural to old age</i>. So true
a picture of life, in the representation of this
<i>weakness</i>, might, in other circumstances, have
created some <i>pleasantry</i>; but the <i>occasion</i>,
which forced it from him, discovering, at the
same time, the <i>amiable disposition</i> of the
speaker, covers the ridicule of it, or more properly
converts it into an object of our <i>esteem</i>.</p>

<p>We have here, then, a kind of <i>intermediate</i>
species of <i>humour</i> betwixt the <i>ridiculous</i> and
the <i>grave</i>; and may perceive how insensibly
the <i>one</i> becomes the <i>other</i>, by the accidental
mixture of a virtuous <i>quality</i>, attracting <i>esteem</i>.
Which may serve to reconcile the
reader to the application of this <i>term</i> even to
such <i>expression</i> of the manners, as is perfectly
<i>serious</i>; that is, where the <i>quality represented</i>
is entirely, and without the least <i>touch</i> of
attending ridicule, the object of <i>moral approbation</i>
to the mind. As in that famous asseveration
of Chremes in the <i>Self-tormentor</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Homo sum: humani nihil &agrave; me alienum puto.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>This is a strong expression of character;
and, coming unaffectedly from him in answer
to the cutting reproof of his friend,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chreme, tantumne ab re tu&acirc;’st ot&icirc; tibi</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aliena ut cures; ea quae nihil ad te adtinent?</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>hath the essence of true <i>humour</i>, that is, is a
<i>lively picture of the manners without design</i>.</p>

<p>Yet in this instance, which hath not been
observed, the <i>humour</i>, though of a serious cast,
is heightened by a mixture of <i>satire</i>. For
we are not to take this, as hath constantly been
done, for a sentiment of pure humanity and
the natural ebullition of benevolence. We
may observe in it a designed stroke of satirical
resentment. <i>The Self-tormentor</i>, as we saw,
had ridiculed Chremes’ <i>curiosity</i> by a severe
reproof. Chremes, to be even with him, reflects
upon the <i>inhumanity</i> of his temper.
“You, says he, seem such a foe to humanity,
that you spare it not <i>in yourself</i>; I, on the
other hand, am affected, when I see it suffer
in <i>another</i>.”</p>

<p>Whence we learn, that, though all which
is requisite to constitute comic humour, be a
<i>just expression of character without design</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
yet such <i>expression</i> is felt more <i>sensibly</i>, when
it is further enlivened by <i>ridicule</i>, or quickened
by the poignancy of <i>satire</i>.</p>

<p>From the account of comedy, here given,
it may appear, that the idea of this drama is
much enlarged beyond what it was in Aristotle’s
time; who defines it to be, <i>an imitation of
light and trivial actions, provoking ridicule</i>.
His notion was taken from the state and practice
of the Athenian stage; that is, from the
<i>old</i> or <i>middle</i> comedy, which answers to this
description. The great revolution, which the
introduction of the <i>new comedy</i> made in the
drama, did not happen till afterwards. This
proposed for its <i>object</i>, in general, <i>the actions
and characters of ordinary life</i>; which are
not, of necessity, ridiculous, but, as appears
to every observer, of a mixt kind, <i>serious</i> as
well as <i>ludicrous</i>, and within their proper
sphere of influence, not unfrequently, even
<i>important</i>. This kind of <i>imitation</i> therefore,
now admits the <i>serious</i>; and its scenes, even
without the least mixture of <i>pleasantry</i>, are
entirely <i>comic</i>. Though the common run of
<i>laughers</i> in our theatre are so little aware of
the extension of this <i>province</i>, that I should
scarcely have hazarded the observation, but for
the authority of <i>Terence</i>; who hath confessedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
very little of the <i>pleasant</i> in his drama. Nay,
one of the most admired of his comedies hath
the gravity, and, in some places, almost the
solemnity of <i>tragedy itself</i>. But this <i>idea</i> of
comedy is not peculiar to the more polite and
liberal <i>ancients</i>. Some of the best <i>modern</i>
comedies are fashioned in agreement to it.
And an instance or two, which I am going to
produce from the stage of simple nature, may
seem to shew it the plain suggestion of common
sense.</p>

<p>“The Amautas (says the author of the
<i>Royal Commentaries of</i> <span class="smcap">Peru</span>), who were
men of the best ingenuity amongst them, invented
<span class="smcap">Comedies</span> and <span class="smcap">Tragedies</span>; which,
on their solemn festivals, they represented
before the King and the Lords of his court.
The plot or argument of their <i>tragedies</i> was
to represent <i>their military exploits, and the
triumphs, victories, and heroic actions of
their renowned men</i>. And the subject or
design of their <i>comedies</i> was, to demonstrate
<i>the manner of good husbandry in cultivating
and manuring their fields, and to shew the
management of domestic affairs, with other
familiar matters</i>. These plays, continues
he, were not made up of obscene and dishonest
farces, but such as were of <i>serious</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
<i>entertainment, composed of grave and acute
sentences</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Two things are observable in this brief account
of the Peruvian drama. <i>First</i>, that its
<i>species</i> had respect to the very different <i>objects</i>
of the <i>higher</i> or <i>lower</i> stations. For the <i>great
and powerful</i> were occupied in <i>war</i>: and
<i>agriculture</i> was the chief employment of <i>private
and ordinary life</i>. And, in this distinction,
these <i>Indian</i>, perfectly agreed with
the old Roman poets; whose <small>PRAETEXTATA</small>
and <small>TOGATA</small> shew, that they had precisely the
same ideas of the drama. <i>Secondly</i>, we do
not learn only, what difference there <i>was</i> betwixt
their tragedy and comedy, but we are
also told, what difference there was <i>not</i>. It
was not, that one was <i>serious</i>, and the other
<i>pleasant</i>. For we find it expressly asserted of
<i>both</i>, that they <i>were of grave and serious entertainment</i>.</p>

<p>And this last will explain a similar observation
on the Chinese, <i>who</i>, as <span class="smcap">P. de Premere</span>
acquaints us, <i>make no distinction betwixt tragedies
and comedies</i>. That is, <i>no distinction</i>,
but what the different <i>subjects</i> of each make
necessary. They do not, as our European
dramas, differ in this, that the <i>one</i> is intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
to make us <i>weep</i>, and the other to make us
<i>laugh</i>.</p>

<p>These are full and precise testimonies. For
I lay no stress on what the Historian of <i>Peru</i>
tells us, <i>that there were no obscenities in their
comedy</i>, nor on what an encomiast of <i>China</i>
pretends, <i>that there is not so much as an obscene
word in all their language</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>: as being
sensible, that though indeed these must needs
be considerable abatements to the <i>humour</i> of
their comic scenes, yet, their ingenuity might
possibly find means to remedy these defects by
the invention and dextrous application of the
<i>double entendre</i>, which, on our stage, is found
to supply the place of rank <i>obscenity</i>, and,
indeed, to do its office of exciting <i>laughter</i>
almost as well.</p>

<p>But, as I said, there is no occasion for this
<i>argument</i>. We may venture, without the
help of it, to join these authorities to <i>that</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Terence; which, together, enable us to conclude
very fully, in opposition to the general
sentiment, that <i>ridicule</i> is not of the <i>essence
of comedy</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>.</p>

<p>But, because the general practice of the
<i>Greek and Roman theatres</i>, which strongly
countenance the other opinion, may still be
thought to outweigh this single <i>Latin poet</i>,
together with all the <i>eastern and western barbarians</i>,
that can be thrown into the balance,
let me go one step further, and, by explaining
the rise and occasion of this <i>practice</i>, demonstrate,
that, in the present case, their authority
is, in fact, of no moment.</p>

<p>The form of the Greek, from whence the
Roman and our drama is taken, though generally
<i>improved</i> by reflexion and just criticism,
yet, like so many other great inventions, was,
in its original, the <i>product</i> of pure chance.
Each of its species had sprung out of a <i>chorus-song</i>,
which was afterwards incorporated into
the legitimate drama, and found essential to
its true form. But <i>reason</i>, which saw to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
establish what was <i>right</i> in this fortuitous conformation
of the drama, did not equally succeed
in detecting and separating what was
<i>wrong</i>. For the <i>occasion</i> of this chorus-song,
in their religious festivities, was widely different:
the business <i>at one time</i>, being to express
their gratitude, in celebrating the praises
of their gods and heroes; at <i>another</i>, to indulge
their mirth, in jesting and sporting
among themselves. The character of their
drama, which had its rise from hence,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> conformed
exactly to the difference of these <i>occasions</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
<i>Tragedy</i>, through all its several successive
stages of improvement, was serious and
even solemn. And a gay or rather buffoon
spirit was the characteristic of <i>comedy</i>.</p>

<p>We see, then, the <i>genius</i> of these two
poems was accidentally fixed in agreement to
their respective <i>originals</i>; consequent writers
contenting themselves to embellish and perfect,
not <i>change</i>, the primary form. The practice
of the ancient stage is then of no further authority,
than as it accords to just criticism.
The solemn cast of their <i>tragedy</i>, indeed,
bears the test, and is found to be suitable to
its real nature. The same does not appear of
the burlesque form of <i>comedy</i>; no reason
having been given, why <i>it</i> must, of necessity,
have the <i>ridiculous</i> for its object. Nay the
effects of improved criticism on the later Greek
comedy give a presumption of the direct contrary.
For, in proportion to the gradual
refinement of this <i>species</i> in the hands of its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
greatest masters, the buffoon cast of the comic
drama was insensibly dropt and even grew into
a severity, which departed at length very
widely from the original idea. The admirable
scholar of <span class="smcap">Theophrastus</span>, who had been tutored
in the exact study of human life, saw so
much of the genuine character of true comedy,
that he cleansed it, at once, from the greater
part of those buffoonries, which had, till his
time, defiled its nature. His great imitator,
Terence, went still further; and, whether impelled
by his native humour, or determined by
his truer taste, mixed so little of the <i>ridiculous</i>
in his comedy, as plainly shews, it might, in
his opinion, subsist entirely without it. His
<i>practice</i> indeed, and the theory, here delivered,
nearly meet. And the conclusion is,
that <i>comedy</i>, which is the image of private
life, may take either character of <i>pleasant</i> or
<i>serious</i>, as it chances, or even <i>unite</i> them into
one piece; but that the <i>former</i> is, by no
means, more essential to its constitution, than
the <i>latter</i>.</p>

<p>I foresee but one objection, that can be
made to this theory; which has, in effect,
been obviated already. “It may be said, that,
if this account of <i>comedy</i> be just, it would
follow, that it might, with equal propriety,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
admit the gravest and most affecting events,
which inferior life furnishes, as the lightest.
Whereas it is notorious, that distresses of a
deep and solemn nature, though faithfully
copied from the fortunes of private men,
would never be endured, under the name of
<i>comedy</i>, on the stage. Nay, such representations
would rather pass, in the public
judgment, for legitimate <i>tragedies</i>; of which
kind, we have, indeed, some examples in
our language.”</p>

<p>Two things are mistaken in this objection.
<i>First</i>, it supposes, that deep distresses of
every kind are inconsistent with comedy; the
contrary of which may be learnt from the
<span class="smcap">Self-tormentor</span> of Terence. <i>Next</i>, it insinuates,
that, if deep distresses of any kind
may be admitted into comedy, the <i>deepest</i>
may. Which is equally erroneous. For the
<i>manners</i> being the proper object of comedy,
the <i>distress</i> must not exceed a certain degree
of <i>severity</i>, lest it draw off the mind from
them, and confine it to the <i>action</i> only: as
would be the case of <i>murder</i>, <i>adultery</i>, and
other atrocious crimes, infesting <i>private</i>, as
well as <i>public</i>, life, were they to be represented,
in all their horrors, on the stage.
And though some of these, as <i>adultery</i>, have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
been brought, of late, into the comic scene,
yet it was not till it had lost the atrocity of
its nature, and was made the subject of mirth
and pleasantry to the fashionable world. But
for this happy disposition of the times, comedy,
as managed by some of our writers,
had lost its nature, and become <i>tragic</i>. And,
yet, considered as <i>tragic</i>, such representations
of low life had been improper. Because, where
the intent is to <i>affect</i>, the subject is with more
advantage taken from <i>high life</i>, all the circumstances
being, there, more peculiarly adapted
to answer that end.</p>

<p>The solution then of the difficulty is, in one
word, this. All <i>distresses</i> are not <i>improper</i>
in comedy; but such only as attach the mind
to the <i>fable</i>, in neglect of the <i>manners</i>, which
are its chief object. On the other hand, all
<i>distresses</i> are not <i>proper</i> in tragedy; but such
only as are of force to interest the mind in the
<i>action</i>, preferably to the observation of the
<i>manners</i>; which can only be done, or is done
most effectually, when the <i>distressful event</i>,
represented, is taken from <i>public life</i>. So that
the <i>distresses</i>, spoken of, are equally unsuited
to what the natures <i>both</i> of <i>comedy and tragedy</i>,
respectively, demand.

<h2 id="CHAP_III">CHAP. III.<br />

<span class="medium">OF M. DE FONTENELLE’S NOTION OF
COMEDY.</span></h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the pains I have taken,
in the preceding chapters, to establish my
theory of the comic drama, I find myself
obliged to support it still further against the
authority of a very eminent modern critic.
M. de Fontenelle hath just now published two
volumes of plays, among which are some comedies
of a very singular character. They are
not only, in a high degree, <i>pathetic</i>; but the
scene of them is laid in <i>antiquity</i>; and great
personages, such as <i>Kings</i>, <i>Princesses</i>, &amp;c.
are of the drama. He hath besides endeavoured
to justify this extraordinary species of
comedy by a very ingenious preface. It will
therefore be necessary for me to examine this
new system, and to obviate, as far as I can,
the prejudices which the name of the author,
and the intrinsic merit of the plays themselves,
will occasion in favour of it.</p>

<p>His system, as explained in the preface to
these comedies, is, briefly, this.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>“The <i>subject</i> of dramatic representation,
he observes, is some event or action of <i>human
life</i>, which can be considered only in
two views, as being either that of <i>public</i>, or
of <i>private</i>, persons. The end of such representation,
continues he, is to <i>please</i>,
which it doth either by engaging the attention,
or by moving the passions. The <i>former</i>
is done by representing to us such
events as are <i>great, noble, or unexpected</i>:
The <i>latter</i> by such as are <i>dreadful, pitiable,
tender, or pleasant</i>. Of these several sources
of <i>pleasure</i>, he forms what he calls a <i>dramatic
scale</i>, the extremes of which he admits
to be altogether inconsistent; no art being
sufficient to bring together the <i>grand</i>, the
<i>noble</i>, or the <i>terrible</i>, into the same piece
with the <i>pleasant or ridiculous</i>. The impressions
of these objects, he allows, are
perfectly opposed to each other. So that a
tragedy, which takes for its subject a <i>noble</i>,
or <i>terrible</i> event, can by no means admit
the <i>pleasant</i>. And a comedy, which represents
a <i>pleasant</i> action, can never admit the
<i>terrible</i> or <i>noble</i>. But it is otherwise, he
conceives, with the intermediate species of
this scale. The <i>singular</i>, the <i>pitiable</i>, the
<i>tender</i>, which fill up the interval betwixt the
<i>noble</i> and <i>ridiculous</i>, are equally consistent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
with tragedy and comedy. An uncommon
stroke of Fortune may as well befall a peasant
as a prince. And two lovers of an inferior
condition may have as lively a passion
for each other, and, when some unlucky
event separates them, may deserve our pity
as much, as those of the highest fortune.
These situations then are equally suited to
both dramas. They will only be modified
in each a little differently. From hence he
concludes, that there may be <i>dramatic representations</i>,
which are neither perfectly
tragedies nor perfectly comedies, but yet
partake of the nature of each, and that in
different proportions. There might be a
species of <i>tragedy</i>, for instance, which should
unite the <i>tender</i> with the <i>noble</i> in any degree,
or even subsist entirely by means of
the <i>tender</i>: And of <i>comedy</i>, which should
associate the <i>tender</i> with the <i>pleasant</i>, or
even retain the <i>tender</i> throughout to a certain
degree to the entire exclusion of the
<i>pleasant</i>.</p>

<p>“As to his laying the <i>scene</i> of his comedy
in Greece, he thinks this practice sufficiently
justified by the practice of the French writers,
who make no scruple to lay their scene
abroad, as in <i>Spain</i> or <i>England</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>“Lastly, for what concerns the introduction
of great personages into the comic drama,
he observes that by <i>ordinary life</i>, which he
supposes the proper subject of comedy, he
understands as well that of Emperors and
Princes, at times when they are only men,
as of inferior persons. And he thinks it
very evident that what passes in the ordinary
<i>life</i>, so understood, of the greatest men, is
truly comic<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>.”</p>

<p>This is a simple exposition of M. de Fontenelle’s
idea of comedy, which, however, he
hath set off with great elegance and a plausibility
of illustration, such as writers of his
class are never at a loss to give to any subject
they would recommend.</p>

<p>Now, tho’ the principal aim of what I have
to offer in confutation of this system be to
combat the ingenious writer’s notion of comedy,
yet as the tenor of his <i>preface</i> leads
him to deliver his sentiments also of tragedy,
I shall not scruple intermixing, after his example,
some reflexions on this latter drama.</p>

<p>M. de Fontenelle sets out with observing,
that the end of dramatic representation is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
<i>please</i>. This end is very general. But he
explains himself more precisely, by saying,
“<i>this pleasure is of two kinds, and consists
either in attaching the mind or affecting it</i>.”
And this is not much amiss. But his further
explanation of these terms is suspicious. “The
mind, says he, is <small>ATTACHED</small> by the representation
of what is <i>great</i>, <i>noble</i>, <i>singular</i>,
or <i>unexpected</i>: It is <small>AFFECTED</small> by what is
<i>terrible</i>, <i>pitiable</i>, <i>tender</i>, or <i>pleasant</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.” In
this enumeration he forgets the merely <i>natural</i>
draught of the manners. Yet this is surely
one of the means by which the drama is enabled
to <i>attach</i> the spectator. With me, I
confess, this is the first excellence of comedy.
Nor could he mean to include this source of
pleasure under his <i>second</i> division. For tho’
a lively picture of the manners may in some
sort be said to <i>affect</i> us, yet certainly not as
coming under the consideration of what is
<i>terrible</i>, <i>pitiable</i>, <i>tender</i>, or <i>ridiculous</i>, but
simply of what is <i>natural</i>. The picture is
<i>pleasant</i> or otherwise, as it chances; but is
always the source of entertainment to the observer.
When the pleasantry is high, it takes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
indeed the passion of <i>ridicule</i>. In other instances,
it can scarcely be said to <i>move</i>,
“emouvoir.” Now this I take to be a very
considerable omission. For if the observation
of character be a <i>pleasure</i>, which comedy is
more particularly qualified to give, and which
is not in any degree so compatible with tragedy,
does not this bid fair for being the <i>proper</i>
end of comedy? Human life, he says,
which is the subject of the drama, can only be
regarded in two views, as either that <i>of the
great and principally of kings</i>, and that of
<i>private men</i>. Now the <i>attachments</i> and <i>emotions</i>,
he speaks of, are excited more powerfully
and to more advantage in a representation
of the <i>former</i>. That which is <i>peculiar</i> to a
draught of <i>ordinary life</i>, or which is attained
<i>most perfectly</i> by it, is the delight arising from
a just exhibition of the manners. No, he will
say. The <i>pleasant</i> belongs as peculiarly to a
picture of common life, as the <i>natural</i>. Surely
not. Common life <i>distorted</i>, or what we call
<i>farce</i>, gives the entertainment of <i>ridicule</i> more
perfectly than comedy. The only pleasure,
which an exposition of <i>ordinary life</i> affords,
distinct from that we receive from a view of
<i>high life</i> on the one hand, and ordinary life
<i>disfigured</i> on the other, is the satisfaction of
contemplating the <i>truth of character</i>. However
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
then this species of representation may be
improved by incorporating other kinds of excellence
with it, is not <i>this, of pleasing</i> by
the <i>truth</i> of character, to be considered as the
<i>appropriate</i> end of comedy?</p>

<p>I don’t dispute the propriety of serious or
even affecting comedies. I have already explained
myself as to this point, and have shewn
under what restrictions <i>the weeping comedy</i>,
<i>la larmoyante comedie</i>, as the French call it,
may be admitted on my plan. The main
question is, whether there be any foundation
in nature for two distinct and separate species
<i>only</i> of the drama; or whether, as he pretends,
a certain <i>scale</i>, which connects by an
insensible communication the several modifications
of dramatic representation, unites and
incorporates the two species into one.</p>

<p>It is true the laws of the drama, as formed
by Aristotle out of the Greek poets, can of
themselves be no rule to us in this matter;
because these poets had given no example of
such intermediate species. This, for aught
appears to the contrary, may be an extension of
the province of the drama. The question then
must be tried by the success of this new practice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
compared with the general dictates of
common sense.</p>

<p>For I perfectly agree with this judicious critic,
that we have a right to inquire if, in what concerns
the stage, we are not sometimes governed
by <i>established customs</i> instead of rules; for
<i>Rules</i> they will not deserve to be esteemed,
till they have undergone the rigid scrutiny of
reason<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.</p>

<p>In respect of the <i>Practice</i>, then, it must be
owned, there are many stories in private life
capable of being worked up in such a manner
as to move the passions strongly; and, on the
contrary, many subjects taken from the great
world capable of diverting the spectator by a
pleasant picture of the manners. And lastly,
it is also true, that both these ends may be
affected together, in some degree, in either
piece. But here is the point of enquiry.
Whether if the end in view be to <i>affect</i>, this
will not be accomplished <small>BETTER</small> by taking a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
subject from the public than private fortunes
of men: Or, if the End be to <i>please by the
truth of character</i>, whether we are not likely
to perceive this pleasure more <small>FULLY</small> when the
story is of private, rather than of public life?
For, as Aristotle said finely on a like occasion,
<i>we are not to look for every sort of pleasure
from tragedy</i> [or comedy] <i>but that which is
peculiarly proper to each</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>. “Human life”
this writer says, “can be considered but as
<i>high</i> or <i>low</i>;” and “a representation of it
can please only as it <i>attaches</i>, or <i>affects</i>.”
I ask then, to which sort of life shall the dramatic
poet confine himself, when he would
endeavour to raise these <i>affections</i> or these <i>attachments</i>
to the highest pitch. The answer
is plain. For if the poet would excite the tender
passions, they will rise higher of necessity,
when awakened by noble subjects, than if called
forth by such as are of ordinary and familiar
notice. This is occasioned by what one may
call a <span class="smcap">transition of the Passions</span>: that affection
of the mind which is produced by the impression
of great objects, being more easily
convertible into the stronger degrees of pity
and commiseration, than such as arises from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
view of the concerns of common life. The
more <i>important</i> the interest, the greater part
our minds take in it, and the more susceptible
are we of <i>passion</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the intended pleasure
is to result from strong pictures of human
nature, this will be felt more entirely, and
with more sincerity, when we are at leisure to
attend to them in the representation of inferior
persons, than when the rank of the speaker,
or dignity of the subject, is constantly drawing
some part of our observation to itself. In a
word, though <i>mixed dramas</i> may give us pleasure,
yet the pleasure, in either kind, will be
<small>LESS</small> in proportion to the mixture. And the
<i>end</i> of each will be then attained <small>MOST PERFECTLY</small>
when its character, according to the
ancient practice, is observed.</p>

<p>To consider then the writer’s favourite position,
that <i>le pitoyable</i> and <i>le tendre</i> are
“common both to tragedy and comedy.” The
position, in general, is true. The difficulty is
in fixing the degree, with which it ought to
prevail in each. If <i>passion</i> predominates in a
picture of private life, I call it a <i>tragedy</i> of
private story, because it produces the <i>end</i> which
tragedy designs. If <i>humour</i> predominates in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
draught of public life, I call it a <i>comedy</i> of
public story, because it gives the <i>pleasure</i> of
pure comedy. Let these then be two new
species of the drama, if you please, and let new
names be invented for them. Yet, were I a
poet, I should certainly adhere to the old
practice. That is, if I wanted to produce <i>passion</i>,
I should think myself able to raise it
highest on a great subject. And if I aimed to
<i>attach</i> by <i>humour</i>, I should depend on catching
the whole attention of the spectator more successfully
on a familiar subject.</p>

<p>But by a <i>familiar subject</i>, this critic will
say, he means, as I do, a subject taken from
<i>ordinary life</i>; and that the affairs of kings
and princes may very properly come into comedy
under this view. Besides the reason
already produced against this innovation, I
have this further exception to it. The business
of comedy, he will allow, is in part at least to
exhibit the <i>manners</i>. Now the princely or
heroic comedy is singularly improper for this
end. If persons of so distinguished a rank be
the actors in comedy, propriety demands that
they be shewn in conformity to their characters
in real life. But now that very politeness,
which reigns in the courts of princes and the
houses of the great, prevents the <i>manners</i> from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
shewing themselves, at least with that distinctness
and <i>relief</i> which we look for in dramatic
characters. Inferior personages, acting with
less reserve and caution, afford the fittest occasion
to the poet of expressing their genuine
tempers and dispositions. Or, if a picture of
the manners be expected from the introduction
of great persons, it can be only in tragedy,
where the importance of the interests and the
strong play of the passions strip them of their
borrowed disguises, and lay open their true
characters. So that the princely, or <i>heroic</i>,
comedy is the least fitted, of any kind of
drama, to furnish this pleasure.</p>

<p>The ancients appear to have had no doubt at
all on the matter. The tragedy on low life,
and comedy on high life, were refinements altogether
unknown to them. What then hath
occasioned this revolution of taste amongst us?
Principally, I conceive, these three things.</p>

<p>1. The comedy on high life hath arisen
from a <i>different state of government</i>. In the
free towns of Greece there was no room for that
distinction of high and low comedy, which the
moderns have introduced. And the reason
was, the members of those communities were
so nearly on a level, that any one was a representative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of the rest. There was no standing
subordination of royalty, nobility, and commonalty,
as with us. Their way of ennobling
their characters was, by making them Generals,
Ambassadors, Magistrates, &amp;c. and then, in
that public view, they were fit personages for
tragedy. When stripped of these ensigns of
authority, they became simple citizens.</p>

<p>Amongst us, persons of elevated rank make
a separate order in the community, whose private
lives however might, no doubt, be the
subject of comic representation. Why then
are not these fit personages for comedy? The
reason has been given. They want <i>dramatic
manners</i>. Or, if they did not, their elevated
and separate estate makes the generality conceive
with such reverence of them, that it
would shock their notions of high life to see
them employed in a course of comic adventures.
And of this M. de Fontenelle himself
was sufficiently sensible. For, speaking in
another place of the importance which the
tragic action receives from the dignity of its
persons, he says, “When the actions are of
such a kind as that, without losing any
thing of their beauty, they might pass between
inferior persons, the names of kings
and princes are nothing but a foreign ornament,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
which the poet gives to his subject.
Yet <i>this ornament, foreign as it may be, is
necessary: so fated are we to be always
dazzled by titles</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.” Should he not have
seen then, that this pageantry of titles, which
is so requisite to raise the dignity of the tragic
drama, must for the same reason prevent the
familiarity of the comic? The great themselves
are, no doubt, in this, as other instances, above
<i>vulgar</i> prejudices. But the dramatic poet
writes for the people.</p>

<p>2. The tragedy on low life, I suspect, has
been chiefly owing to our <i>modern romances</i>:
which have brought the tender passion into
great repute. It is the constant and almost
sole object of <i>le pitoyable</i> and <i>le tendre</i> in our
drama. Now the prevalency of this passion
in all degrees hath made it thought an indifferent
matter, whether the story, that exemplifies
it, be taken from low or high life. As
it rages equally in both, the pathos, it was believed,
would be just the same. And it is
true, if tragedy confine itself to the display of
this passion, the difference will be less sensible
than in other instances. Because the concern
terminates more directly in the <i>tender pair</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
themselves, and does not so necessarily extend
itself to others. Yet to heighten this same
pathos by the <i>grand</i> and <i>important</i>, would
methinks be the means of affording a still
higher pleasure.</p>

<p>3. After all, that effusion of <i>softness</i> which
prevails to such a degree in all our dramas,
comic as well as tragic, to the exclusion of every
other interest, is, perhaps, best accounted for
by this writer. As the matter is delicate, I
chuse to give it in his own words: “On s’imagine
naturellement, que les pi&eacute;ces Grecques
&amp; les n&ocirc;tres ont &eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute;es au m&ecirc;me tribunal,
&agrave; celui d’un public ass&eacute;s egal dans les deux
nations; mais cela n’est pas tout-a-fait vrai.
Dans le tribunal d’Athenes, <i>les femmes</i>
n’avoient pas de voix, ou n’en avoient que
tr&egrave;s peu. Dans le tribunal de Paris, c’est
pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment le contraire; ici il est donc
question de plaire aux femmes, qui assur&eacute;ment
aimeront mieux le pitoyable &amp; le tendre,
que terrible et m&ecirc;me le grand.” He
adds, “<i>Et je ne crois pas au fond qu’elles
ayent grand tort</i>.” And what gallant man
but would subscribe to this opinion?</p>

<p>On the whole, this attempt of M. de Fontenelle,
to innovate in the province of comedy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
puts one in mind of that he made, many years
ago, in pastoral poetry. It is exactly the
same spirit which has governed this polite
writer in both adventures. He was once for
bringing courtiers in masquerade into <i>Arcadia</i>.
And now he would set them unmasked on the
comic stage. Here, at least, he thought they
would be in place. But the simplicity of pastoral
dialogue would not suffer the one; and
the familiarity of comic action forbids the
other. It must be confessed, however, he
hath succeeded better in the example of his
comedies, than his pastorals. And no wonder.
For what we call the <i>fashions</i> and <i>manners</i>
are confined to certain conditions of life,
so that <i>pastoral courtiers</i> are an evident contradiction
and absurdity. But, the <i>appetites
and passions</i> extending through all ranks,
hence low tricks and low amours are thought
to suit the minister and sharper alike. However
it be, the fact is, that M. de Fontenelle
hath succeeded best in his <i>comedies</i>. And as
his theory is likely to gain more credit from
the success of his practice than the force of his
reasoning, I think it proper to close these remarks
with an observation or two upon it.</p>

<p>There are, I observed, three things to be
considered in his comedies, his <i>introduction of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
<i>great personages, his practice of laying the
scene in antiquity, and his pathos</i>.</p>

<p>Now to see the impropriety of the <i>first</i> of
these innovations, we need only observe with
what art he endeavours to conceal it. His
very dexterity in managing his comic heroes
clearly shews the natural repugnance he felt in
his own mind betwixt the representation of
such characters, and even his own idea of the
comic drama.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tyrant</span> is a strange title of a comedy.
It required singular address to familiarize this
frightful personage to our conceptions. Which
yet he hath tolerably well done, but by such
expedients as confute his general theory. For,
to bring him down to the level of a comic character,
he gives us to understand, that the
<i>Tyrant</i> was an usurper, who from a very mean
birth had forced his way into the tyranny.
And to lower him still more, we find him represented,
not only as odious to his people,
but of a very contemptible character. He further
makes him the tyrant only of a small
Greek town; so that he passes, with the modern
reader, for little more than the Mayor of
a corporation. There is also a plain illusion
in making a <i>simple citizen</i> demand his daughter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
in marriage. For under the cover of this
word, which conveys the idea of a person in
lower life, we think very little of the dignity
of a free citizen of Corinth. Whence it appears
that the poet felt the necessity of unkinging
this tyrant as far as possible, before
he could make a comic character of him.</p>

<p>The case of his <span class="smcap">Abdolonime</span> is still easier.
’Tis true, the structure of the fable requires
us to have an eye to royalty, but all the pride
and pomp of the regal character is studiously
kept out of sight. Besides, the affair of
royalty does not commence till the action
draws to a conclusion, the persons of the
drama being all simple particulars, and even of
the lowest figure through the entire course of it.</p>

<p>The King of Sidon is, further, a paltry sovereign,
and a creature of Alexander. And
the characters of the persons, which are indeed
admirably touched, are purposely contrived to
lessen our ideas of sovereignty.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lysianasse</span> is a tragedy in form, of
that kind which hath a happy catastrophe.
The <i>persons</i>, <i>subject</i>, every thing so important,
and attaches the mind so intirely to the
event, that nothing interests more.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>As to his <i>laying the scene in antiquity, and
especially in the free towns of Greece</i>, I would
recommend it as an admirable expedient to all
those who are disposed to follow him in this
new province of heroic comedy. For amongst
other advantages, it gives the writer an occasion
to fill the courts of his princes with <i>simple
citizens</i>, which, as was observed, by no means
answer to our ideas of nobility. But in any
other view I cannot say much for the practice.
It is for obvious reasons highly inconvenient.
Even this writer found it so, when in one of
his plays, the <span class="smcap">Macate</span>, he was obliged to
break through the propriety of ancient manners
in order to adapt himself to the modern
taste. His duel, as he himself says, “<i>a l’air
bien fran&ccedil;ois et bien peu grec</i>.” The reader,
if he pleases, may see his apology for this
transgression of decorum. Or, if there were no
inconvenience of this sort, the representation
of characters after the <i>antique</i> must, on many
occasions, be cold and disgusting. At least none
but professed scholars can be taken with it.</p>

<p>Nor is the usage of the Latin writers any
precedent. For, besides that Horace, we
know, condemned it as suitable only to the
infancy of their comic poetry, the manners,
laws, religion of the Greeks were in the main
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
so similar to their own, that the difference
was hardly discernible. Or if it were otherwise
in some points, the neighbourhood of this famous
people and the intercourse the Romans
had with them, would bring them perfectly
acquainted with such difference. And this last
reflexion shews how insufficient it was for the
author to excuse his own practice from the
authority of his countrymen; who, says he,
“never scruple laying their scene in Spain or
England.” Are the manners of ancient
Greece as familiar to a French pit, as those of
these two countries?</p>

<p>Lastly, I have very little to object to the
<i>pathos</i> of his comedy. When it is subservient
to the <i>manners</i>, as in the <span class="smcap">Testament</span> and <span class="smcap">Abdolonime</span>,
I think it admirable. When it
exceeds this degree and takes the attention intirely,
as in the <span class="smcap">Lysianasse</span>, it gives a pleasure
indeed, but not the pleasure appropriate to
comedy. I regard it as a faint imperfect species
of tragedy. After all, I fear the <i>tender
and pitiable</i> in comedy, though it must afford
the highest pleasure to sensible and elegant
minds, is not perfectly suited to the apprehensions
of the generality. Are they susceptible
of the soft and delicate emotions which the
fine distress in the <i>Testament</i> is intended to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
raise? Every one indeed is capable of being
delighted through the <i>passions</i>; but they must
be worked up, as in tragedy, to a greater
height, before the generality can receive that
delight from them. The same objection, it
will be said, holds against the finer strokes of
character. Not, I think, with the same force.
I doubt our sense of imitation, especially of
the <i>ridiculous</i>, is quicker than our humanity.
But I determine nothing. Both these pleasures
are perfectly consistent. And my idea
of comedy requires only that the <i>pathos</i> be
kept in subordination to the <i>manners</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.<br />

<span class="medium">OF THE PROVINCE OF FARCE.</span></h2>

<p>Thus much then for the general idea of <span class="smcap">Comedy</span>.
If considered more accurately, it is,
further, of <i>two kinds</i>. And in considering
these we shall come at a just notion of the
province of <small>FARCE</small>. For this <i>mirror of private
life</i> either, 1. reflects such qualities and characters,
as are common <i>to human nature at
large</i>: or, 2. it represents the whims, extravagances,
and caprices, which characterize the
folly of <i>particular persons or times</i>.</p>

<p>Again, <i>each</i> of these is, further, to be subdivided
into <i>two species</i>. For 1. the representations
of <i>common nature</i> may either be
taken <i>accurately</i>, so as to reflect a <i>faithful
and exact image</i> of their original; which alone
is <i>that</i> I would call <small>COMEDY</small>, as best agreeing
to the description which Cicero gives of it,
when he terms it <small>IMAGINEM VERITATIS</small>. Or,
they may be forced and overcharged above the
simple and just proportions of <i>nature</i>; as when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the excesses of a <i>few</i> are given for <i>standing</i>
characters, when not the man is described, but
the <i>passion</i>, or when, in the draught of the
man, the leading feature is extended beyond
measure: And in these cases the representation
holds of the lower province of <span class="smcap">Farce</span>. In
like manner, 2. the other <i>species</i>, consisting
in the representation of <i>partial nature</i>, either
transcribes such characters as are peculiar to
<i>certain countries or times</i>, of which <i>our comedy</i>
is, in great measure, made up; or it
presents the image of <i>some real individual
person</i>; which was the distinguishing character
of the <i>old comedy</i> properly so called.</p>

<p>Both these kinds evidently belong to <small>FARCE</small>:
not only as failing in that general and universal
imitation of nature, which is alone deserving
the name of comedy, but, also, for this reason,
that, being more directly written for the present
purpose of discrediting certain <i>characters</i>
or <i>persons</i>, it is found convenient to exaggerate
their peculiarities and enlarge their features;
and so, on a double account, they are to be
referred to that <i>class</i>.</p>

<p>And thus the <i>three forms of dramatic composition</i>,
the only ones which good sense
acknowledges, are kept distinct: and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
proper <small>END</small> and <small>CHARACTER</small> of each, clearly
understood.</p>

<p>1. <i>Tragedy and Comedy</i>, by their lively
but faithful representations, cannot fail to <i>instruct</i>.
Such natural exhibitions of the human
character, being set before us in the clear
mirror of the drama, must needs serve to the
highest <i>moral uses</i>, in awakening that instinctive
approbation, which we cannot withhold
from <i>virtue</i>, or in provoking the not less
necessary detestation of <i>vice</i>. But this, though
it be their best <i>use</i>, is by no means their
primary <i>intention</i>. Their proper and immediate
<i>end</i> is, to <small>PLEASE</small>: the <i>one</i>, more especially
by interesting the <i>affections</i>; the <i>other</i>,
by <i>a just and delicate imitation of real life</i>.
<i>Farce</i>, on the contrary, professes to <i>entertain</i>,
but this, in order more effectually to serve the
interests of virtue and good sense. Its proper
<i>end</i> and purpose (if we allow it to have any
reasonable one) is, then, to <small>INSTRUCT</small>. Which
the reader will understand me as saying, not
of what we know by the name of <i>farce</i> on the
modern stage (whose <i>prime</i> intention can
hardly be thought even that low one, ascribed
to it by Mr. Dryden, <i>of</i> entertaining <i>citizens,
country gentlemen, and Covent Garden fops</i>),
but of the legitimate <i>end</i> of this <i>drama</i>; known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to the Ancients under the name of the <i>old
Comedy</i>, but having neither name nor existence,
properly speaking, among the Moderns.
Of which we may say, as Mr. Dryden did,
but with less propriety, of Comedy, “<i>That it
is a sharp manner of</i> instruction <i>for the
vulgar, who are never well amended, till
they are more than sufficiently exposed</i>.”
[Pref. to Trans. of Fresnoy, p. xix.]</p>

<p>2. Though tragedy and comedy respect the
<i>same general</i> <small>END</small>, yet pursuing it by <i>different
means</i>, hence it comes to pass, their <small>CHARACTERS</small>
are wholly different. For tragedy, aiming
at <i>pleasure</i>, principally through the <i>affections</i>,
whose flow must not be checked and interrupted
by any counter impressions: and comedy,
as we have seen, addressing itself <i>principally</i>
to our <i>natural sense of resemblance
and imitation</i>; it follows, that the <i>ridiculous</i>
can never be associated with tragedy, without
destroying its <i>nature</i>, though with the <i>serious
comic</i> it very well consists.</p>

<p>And here the <i>practice</i> coincides with the
<i>rule</i>. All exact writers, though they constantly
mix <i>grave and pleasant</i> scenes together
in the same <i>comedy</i>, yet never presume to do
this in <i>tragedy</i>, and so keep the two species of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
<i>tragedy and comedy</i> themselves perfectly distinct.
But,</p>

<p>3. It is quite otherwise with <i>comedy</i> and
<i>farce</i>. These almost perpetually run into
each other. And yet the reason of the thing
demands as intire and perfect a separation in
this case, as in the other. For the perfection
of <i>comedy</i> lying in the accuracy and fidelity of
universal representation, and <i>farce</i> professedly
neglecting or rather purposely transgressing
the limits of common nature and just decorum,
they clash entirely with each other. And <i>comedy</i>
must so far fail of giving the <i>pleasure</i>,
appropriate to its design, as it allies itself with
<i>farce</i>; while <i>farce</i>, on the other hand, forfeits
the <i>use</i>, it intends, of promoting popular ridicule,
by restraining itself within the exact
rules of <i>Nature</i>, which Comedy observes.</p>

<p>But there is little occasion to guard against
this <i>latter</i> abuse. The danger is all on the
other side. And the passion for what is now
called <i>Farce</i>, the shadow of the Old Comedy,
has, in fact, possessed the modern poets to
such a degree that we have scarcely one example
of a comedy, without this gross mixture.
If any are to be excepted from this censure in
Moliere, they are his <i>Misanthrope</i> and <i>Tartuffe</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
which are accordingly, by common allowance,
the best of his large collection. In
proportion as his other plays have less or more
of this farcical turn, their true value hath been
long since determined.</p>

<p>Of our own comedies, such of them, I mean,
as are worthy of criticism, Ben Jonson’s <i>Alchymist</i>
and <i>Volpone</i> bid the fairest for being
written in this genuine unmixed manner. Yet,
though their merits are very great, severe Criticism
might find something to object even to
these. The <span class="smcap">Alchymist</span>, some will think, is
exaggerated throughout, and so, at best, belongs
to that species of comedy, which we
have before called <i>particular and partial</i>. At
least, the extravagant pursuit so strongly exposed
in that play, hath now, of a long time,
been forgotten; so that we find it difficult to
enter fully into the humour of this highly-wrought
character. And, in general, we may
remark of such characters, that they are a
strong temptation to the writer to exceed the
bounds of truth in his draught of them at <i>first</i>,
and are further liable to an imperfect, and even
unfair sentence from the reader <i>afterwards</i>.
For the welcome reception, which these pictures
of prevailing <i>local</i> folly meet with on the stage,
cannot but induce the poet, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
without design, to inflame the representation:
And the want of <i>archetypes</i>, in a little time,
makes it pass for immoderate, were it originally
given with ever so much discretion and justice.
So that whether the <i>Alchymist</i> be farcical or
not, it will <i>appear</i>, at least, to have this note
of Farce, “That the principal character is exaggerated.”
But then this is all we must
affirm. For as to the <i>subject</i> of this Play’s
being a <i>local folly</i>, which seems to bring it
directly under the denomination of Farce, it
is but just to make a distinction. Had the <i>end
and purpose</i> of the Play been to expose <i>Alchymy</i>,
it had been liable to this objection.
But this mode of <i>local folly</i>, is employed as
the <i>means</i> only of exposing <i>another</i> folly, extensive
as our Nature and coeval with it, namely
<i>Avarice</i>. So that the subject has all the requisites
of true <i>Comedy</i>. It is just otherwise,
we may observe, in the <i>Devil’s an Ass</i>; which
therefore properly falls under our censure.
For there, the folly of the time, <i>Projects and
Monopolies</i>, are brought in to be exposed, as
the <i>end and purpose</i> of the comedy.</p>

<p>On the whole, the <i>Alchymist</i> is a Comedy
in just form, but a little <i>Farcical</i> in the extension
of one of its characters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Volpone</span>, is a subject so manifestly
fitted for the entertainment of all times, that
it stands in need of no vindication. Yet neither,
I am afraid, is this Comedy, in all respects,
a complete model. There are even
some Incidents of a farcical invention; particularly
the <i>Mountebank Scene</i> and <i>Sir Politique’s
Tortoise</i> are in the taste of the <i>old
comedy</i>; and without its rational purpose.
Besides, the <i>humour</i> of the dialogue is sometimes
on the point of becoming inordinate, as
may be seen in the pleasantry of <i>Corbaccio’s
mistakes through deafness</i>, and in other instances.
And we shall not wonder that the
best of his plays are liable to some objections
of this sort, if we attend to the <i>character</i> of
the writer. For his nature was severe and
rigid, and this in giving a strength and manliness,
gave, at times too, an intemperance to
his satyr. His taste for ridicule was strong
but indelicate, which made him not over-curious
in the choice of his <i>topics</i>. And lastly,
his <i>style</i> in picturing characters, though masterly,
was without that elegance of <i>hand</i>,
which is required to correct and allay the force
of so bold a colouring. Thus, the bias of his
nature leading him to Plautus rather than
Terence for his model, it is not to be wondered
that his wit is too frequently caustic; his
raillery coarse; and his humour excessive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>Some later writers for the stage have, no
doubt, avoided these defects of the exactest of
our old dramatists. But do they reach his
excellencies? Posterity, I am afraid, will
judge otherwise, whatever may be now thought
of some more fashionable comedies. And if
they do not, neither the state of general manners,
nor the turn of the public taste, appears
to be such as countenances the expectation of
greater improvements. To those who are
not over-sanguine in their hopes, our forefathers
will perhaps be thought to have furnished
(what, in nature, seem linked together)
the fairest example of <i>dramatic</i>, as of <i>real
manners</i>.</p>

<p>But here it will probably be said, an affected
zeal for the honour of our old poets has
betrayed their unwary advocate into a concession,
which discredits his whole pains on this
subject. For to what purpose, may it be
asked, this waste of dramatic criticism, when,
by the allowance of the idle speculatist himself,
his theory is likely to prove so unprofitable,
at least, if it be not ill-founded? The
only part I can take in this nice conjuncture,
is to screen myself behind the authority of a
much abler critical theorist, who had once the
misfortune to find himself in these unlucky
circumstances, and has apologized for it. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
<i>objection</i> is fairly urged by this fine writer;
and in so profound and speculative an age, as
the present, I presume to suggest no other
answer, than he has thought fit to give to it.
“Speculations of this sort, says he, do not bestow
genius on those who have it not; they
do not, perhaps, afford any great assistance
to those who have; and most commonly the
men of genius are even incapable of being
assisted by speculation. To what use then
do they serve? Why, to lead up <i>to the
first principles of beauty</i> such persons as
love reasoning and are fond of reducing, under
the controul of philosophy, subjects that
appear the most independent of it, and
which are generally thought abandoned to
the caprice of taste<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.”

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Secondly, “<i>Whether, in the case of confessed
Imitations, any certain and necessary
conclusion holds to the disadvantage
of the natural</i> <small>GENIUS</small> <i>of the imitator?</i>”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Questions</span>,
which there seems no fit method
of resolving, but by taking the matter pretty
deep, and deducing it from its <i>first principles</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<h3>SECTION I.</h3>

<p>All <i>Poetry</i>, to speak with Aristotle and
the Greek critics (if for so plain a point authorities
be thought wanting) is, properly, <i>imitation</i>.
It is, indeed, the noblest and most
extensive of the mimetic arts; having all creation
for its object, and ranging the entire circuit
of universal being. In this view every
wondrous <i>original</i>, which ages have gazed at,
as the offspring of creative fancy; and of which
poets themselves, to do honour to their inventions,
have feigned, as of the immortal panoply
of their heroes, that it came down from heaven,
is itself but a <i>copy</i>, a transcript from some
brighter page of this vast volume of the universe.
Thus all is <i>derived</i>; all is <i>unoriginal</i>.
And the office of genius is but to select the
fairest forms of things, and to present them in
due <i>place</i> and <i>circumstance</i>, and in the richest
colouring of <i>expression</i>, to the imagination.
This primary or original <i>copying</i>, which in
the ideas of Philosophy is <i>Imitation</i>, is, in the
language of Criticism, called <span class="smcap">Invention</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>Again; of the endless variety of these <i>original
forms</i>, which the poet’s eye is incessantly
traversing, those, which take his attention
most, his active mimetic faculty prompts him
to convert into fair and living <i>resemblances</i>.
This magical operation the <i>divine</i> philosopher
(whose fervid fancy, though it sometimes obscures<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
his reasoning, yet never fails to clear
and brighten his imagery) excellently illustrates
by the similitude of a <i>mirror</i>; “<i>which</i>,
says he, <i>as you turn about and oppose to the
surrounding world, presents you instantly
with a</i> <small>SUN</small>, <small>STARS</small>, <i>and</i> <small>SKIES</small>; <i>with your</i>
<small>OWN</small>, <i>and every</i> <small>OTHER</small> <i>living form; with
the</i> <small>EARTH</small>, <i>and its several appendages of</i>
<small>TREES</small>, <small>PLANTS</small>, <i>and</i> <small>FLOWERS</small><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.” Just so,
on whatever side the poet turns his imagination,
the shapes of things immediately imprint
themselves upon it, and a new corresponding
creation reflects the old one. This shadowy
ideal world, though unsubstantial as the <i>American
vision of souls</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>, yet glows with such
apparent life, that it becomes, thenceforth,
the object of other mirrors, and is itself <i>original</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
to future reflexions; This secondary or derivative
image, is that alone which Criticism
considers under the Idea of <span class="smcap">Imitation</span>.</p>

<p>And here the difficulty, we are about to
examine, commences. For the poet, in his
quick researches through all his stores and
materials of <i>beauty</i>, meeting every where, in
his progress, these <i>reflected forms</i>; and deriving
from them his stock of imagery, as well
as from the real subsisting objects of nature,
the reader is often at a loss (for the poet himself
is not always aware of it) to discern the
<i>original</i> from the <i>copy</i>; to know, with certainty,
if the <i>sentiment</i>, or <i>image</i>, presented
to him, be directly taken from the <i>life</i>, or be
itself, a lively transcript, only, of some former
copy. And this difficulty is the greater, because
the <i>original</i>, as well as the <i>copy</i>, is always
at hand for the poet to turn to, and we
can rarely be certain, since both were equally
in his power, which of the two he chose to
make the object of his own <i>imitation</i>. For it
is not enough to say here, as in the case of
<i>reflexions</i>, that the latter is always the weaker,
and of course betrays itself by the degree of
faintness, which, of necessity, attends a <i>copy</i>.
This, indeed, hath been said by one, to whose
judgment a peculiar deference is owing. <span class="smcap">Quicquid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
alteri simile est, necesse est minus
sit eo, quod imitatur</span><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. But it holds only
of strict and scrupulous <i>imitations</i>. And of
such alone, I think, it was intended; for the
explanation follows, <i>ut umbra corpore, &amp;
imago facie, &amp; actus histrionum veris affectibus</i>;
that is, where the artist confines himself
to the single view of taking a faithful and
exact transcript. And even this can be allowed
only, when the copyist is of inferior, or
at most but of equal, talents. Nay, it is not
certainly to be relied upon even <i>then</i>; as may
appear from what we are told of an inferior
painter’s [Andrea del Sarto’s] copying a portrait
of the divine Raphael. The story is well
known. But, as an aphorism, brought to determine
the merits of <i>imitation</i>, in general,
nothing can be falser or more delusive. For,
1. Besides the supposed <i>original</i>, the object
itself, as was observed, is before the poet, and
he may catch from thence, and infuse into his
piece, the same glow of real life, which animated
the <i>first copy</i>. 2. He may also take
in circumstances, omitted or overlooked before
in the <i>common</i> object, and so give new and
additional vigour to his imitation. Or, 3. He
may possess a stronger, and more plastic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
genius, and therefore be enabled to touch,
with more force of expression, even those particulars,
which he professedly imitates.</p>

<p>On all these accounts, the difficulty of distinguishing
betwixt <i>original</i>, and <i>secondary</i>,
imitation is apparent. And it is of importance,
that this <i>difficulty</i> be seen in its full
light. Because, if the <i>similarity</i>, observed in
two or more writers, may, for the most part,
and with the highest probability, be accounted
for from <i>general principles</i>, it is superfluous
at least, if not unfair, to have recourse to the
<i>particular</i> charge of <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>Now to see how far the same common principles
of nature will go towards effecting the
<i>similarity</i>, here spoken of, it is necessary to
consider very distinctly.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The matter</span>; <i>and</i></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The manner</span>, <i>of all poetical imitation</i>.</p>

<p>I. In all that range of <i>natural objects</i>, over
which the restless imagination of the poet
expatiates, there is no subject of picture or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
imitation, that is not reducible to one or other
of the <i>three following classes</i>. 1. The <i>material
world, or that vast compages of corporeal
forms, of which this universe is compounded</i>.
2. <i>The internal workings and movements of
his own mind, under which I comprehend the
manners, sentiments, and passions.</i> 3. <i>Those
internal operations, that are made objective
to sense by the outward signs of gesture, attitude,
or action.</i> Besides these I know of
no source, whence the artist can derive a single
sentiment or image. There needs no new distinction
in favour of <i>Homer’s gods</i>, <i>Milton’s
angels</i>, or <i>Shakespear’s witches</i>; it being
clear, that these are only <i>human</i> characters,
diversified by such attributes and manners, as
superstition, religion, or even wayward fancy,
had assigned to each.</p>

<p>1. The material universe, or what the
painters call <i>still life</i>, is the object of that
species of poetical imitation, we call <i>descriptive</i>.
This beauteous arrangement of natural
objects, which arrests the attention on all sides,
makes a necessary and forceable impression on
the human mind. We are so constituted, as
to have a quick <i>perception</i> of beauty in the
<i>forms</i>, <i>combinations</i>, and <i>aspects</i> of things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
about us; which the philosopher may amuse
himself in explaining from remote and insufficient
considerations; but consciousness and
common feeling will never suffer us to doubt
of its being entirely <i>natural</i>. Accordingly we
may observe, that it operates universally on all
men; more especially the young and unexperienced;
who are not less transported by the
<i>novelty</i>, than <i>beauty</i> of material objects. But
its impressions are strongest on those, whom
nature hath touched with a ray of that celestial
fire, which we call true <i>genius</i>. Here the workings
of this instinctive sense are so powerful,
that, to judge from its effects, one should
conclude, it perfectly intranced and bore away
the mind, as in a fit of rapture. Whenever
the form of natural beauty presents itself,
though but casually, to the mind of the poet;
busied it may be, and intent on the investigation
of quite other objects; his imagination
takes fire, and it is with difficulty that he restrains
himself from quitting his proper pursuit,
and stopping a while to survey and delineate
the enchanting image. This is the character
of what we call a <i>luxuriant fancy</i>, which
all the rigour of art can hardly keep down;
and we give the highest praise of judgment to
those few, who have been able to discipline
and confine it within due limits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>I insist the more on this strong <i>influence of
external beauty</i>, because it leads, I think, to a
clear view of the subject before us, so far as it respects
<i>descriptive poetry</i>. These <i>living forms</i>
are, without any change, presented to observation
in every age and country. There needs
but opening the eyes, and these forms necessarily
imprint themselves on the fancy; and
the love of <i>imitation</i>, which naturally accompanies
and keeps pace with this <i>sense of beauty</i>
in the poet, is continually urging him to translate
them into <i>description</i>. These descriptions
will, indeed, have different degrees of <i>colouring</i>,
according to the force of genius in the
imitator; but the <i>outlines</i> are the same in all;
in the weak, faint sketches of an ordinary
Gothic designer, as in the living pictures of
<i>Homer</i>.</p>

<p>An instance will explain my meaning.
Amidst all that diversity of natural objects,
which the poet delights to paint, nothing is
so <i>taking</i> to his imagination, as <i>rural scenery</i>;
which is, always, the <i>first</i> passion of <i>good</i>
poets, and the <i>only</i> one that seems, in any
degree, to animate and inspirit <i>bad</i> ones.
Now let us take a description of such a scene;
suppose that which <i>Aelian</i> hath left us of the
Grecian <small>TEMPE</small>, given from the life and without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the heightenings of poetic ornament; and we
shall see how little the imagination of the most
fanciful poets hath ever done towards improving
upon it. <i>Aelian’s</i> description is given in these
words.</p>

<p>“The Thessalian <span class="smcap">Tempe</span> is a place situate
between Olympus and Ossa; which are
mountains of an exceeding great height; and
look, as if they once had been joined, but
were afterwards separated from each other,
by some god, for the sake of opening in the
midst that large plain, which stretches in
length to about five miles, and in breadth a
hundred paces, or, in some parts, more.
Through the middle of this plain runs the
<i>Peneus</i>, into which several lesser currents
empty themselves, and, by the confluence
of their waters, swell it into a river of great
size. This vale is abundantly furnished
with all manner of <i>arbours and resting
places</i>; not such as the arts of human industry
contrive, but which the bounty of
spontaneous nature, ambitious, as it were,
to make a shew of all her beauties, provided
for the supply of this fair residence, in the
very original structure and formation of the
place. For there is plenty of <i>ivy</i> shooting
forth in it, which flourishes and grows so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
thick, that, like the generous and leafy vine,
it crawls up the trunks of tall trees, and
twining its foliage round their arms and
branches, becomes almost incorporated with
them. The flowering <i>smilax</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> also is there
in great abundance; which running up the
acclivities of the hills, and spreading the
close texture of its leaves and tendrils on all
sides, perfectly covers and shades them; so
that no part of the bare rock is seen; but
the whole is hung with the verdure of a
thick, inwoven herbage, presenting the most
agreeable spectacle to the eye. Along the
level of the plain, there are frequent tufts of
trees, and long continued ranges of arching
bowers, affording the most grateful shelter
from the heats of summer; which are further
relieved by the frequent streams of clear
and fresh water, continually winding through
it. The tradition goes, that these waters are
peculiarly good for bathing, and have many
other medicinal virtues. In the thickets and
bushes of this dale are numberless <i>singing</i>
birds, every where fluttering about, whose
warblings take the ear of passengers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
cheat the labours of their way through it.
On the banks of the <i>Peneus</i>, on either side,
are dispersed irregularly those <i>resting places</i>,
before spoken of; while the river itself glides
through the middle of the lawn, with a soft
and quiet lapse; over-hung with the shades
of trees, planted on its borders, whose intermingled
branches keep off the rays of the
sun, and furnish the opportunity of a cool
and temperate navigation upon it. The
worship of the gods, and the perpetual fragrancy
of sacrifices and burning odours, further
consecrate the place, &amp;c.” [<i>Var. Hist.</i>
lib. III. c. 1.]</p>

<p>Now this picture, which Aelian took from
nature, and which any one, if he hath not
seen the several parts of it subsisting together,
may easily compound for himself out of that
stock of rural images which are reposited in
the memory, is, in fact, the substance of
all those luscious and luxuriant paintings,
which poetry hath ever been able to <i>feign</i>.
For what more is there in the <i>Elysiums</i>, the
<i>Arcadias</i>, the <i>Edens</i>, of ancient and modern
fame? And the common <i>object</i> of all these
pictures being continually present to the eye,
what way is there of avoiding the most exact
agreement of representation in them? Or how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
from any <i>similarity</i> in the materials, of which
they are formed, shall we infer an <i>imitation</i>?</p>

<p>This agreeable scenery is, for an obvious
reason, the most frequent object of description.
Though sometimes it chuses to itself a
dark and sombrous imagery; which nature,
again, holds out to imitation; or fancy, which
hath a wondrous quickness and facility in opposing
its ideas, readily suggests. We have
an instance in the picture of that <i>horrid and
detested vale</i> which Tamora describes in <span class="smcap">Titus
Andronicus</span>. It is a perfect contrast to
Aelian’s, and may be called an <i>Anti-tempe</i>. Or,
to see this opposition of images in the strongest
light, the reader may turn to <i>L’Allegro</i> and
<i>Il Penseroso</i> of Milton; where he hath artfully
made, throughout the two poems, the
same kind of subjects excite the two passions
of <i>mirth</i> and <i>melancholy</i>.</p>

<p>When the reader is got into this train, he
will easily extend the same observation to other
instances of <i>natural description</i>; and can
hardly avoid, after a few trials, coming to this
short conclusion, “that of all the various delineations
in the poets, of the <small>HEAVENS</small>, in
their vicissitude of times and seasons; of
the <small>EARTH</small>, in its diversity of <i>mountains</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
<i>valleys</i>, <i>promontories</i>, &amp;c. of the <small>SEA</small>, under
its several aspects of <i>turbulence</i>, or <i>serenity</i>;
of the <i>make</i> and <i>structure</i> of <small>ANIMALS</small>, &amp;c.
it can rarely be affirmed, that they are <i>copies</i>
of one another, but rather the genuine
products of the same creating fancy, operating
uniformly in them all.”</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding this <i>identity</i> of the
subject-matter in natural description, there is
room enough for true Genius to shew itself.
To omit other considerations for the present,
it will more especially appear in the <i>manner of
Representation</i>; by which is not meant the
language of the poet, but simply the <i>form</i>
under which he chuses to present his imagery
to the fancy. The reader will excuse my
adding a word on so curious a subject, which
he will readily apprehend from the following
instance.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the <i>morning</i> are very frequent
in the poets. But this appearance is
known by so many attending circumstances,
that there will be room for a considerable variety
in the pictures of it. It may be described
by those <i>stains of light</i>, which streak and diversify
the clouds; by the peculiar <i>colour of
the dawn</i>; by its <i>irradiations</i> on the <i>sea</i>, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
<i>earth</i>; on some peculiar objects, as <i>trees</i>,
<i>hills</i>, <i>rivers</i>, &amp;c. A difference also will arise
from the <i>situation</i>, in which we suppose ourselves;
if on the <i>sea shore</i>, this <i>harbinger of
day</i> will seem to break forth from the <i>ocean</i>;
if on the <i>land</i>, from the extremity of a large
plain, terminated, it may be, by some remarkable
object, as a <i>grove</i>, <i>mountain</i>, &amp;c.
There are many other <i>differences</i>, of which
the same precise <i>number</i> will scarcely offer itself
to two poets; or not the <i>same individual</i>
circumstances; or not <i>disposed</i> in the same
manner. But let the same identical circumstance,
suppose the <i>breaking or first appearance
of the dawn</i>, be taken by different writers,
and we may still expect a considerable diversity
in their <i>representation</i> of it. What we may
allow to all poets, is, that they will <i>impersonate</i>
the morning. And though this idea of it
is <i>metaphorical</i>, and so belongs to another
place, as respecting the <i>manner</i> of imitation
only; yet, when once considered under this
<i>figure</i>, the <i>drawing</i> of it comes as directly
within the province of <i>description</i>, as the real,
<i>literal</i> circumstances themselves. Now in descriptions
of the morning under this idea of a
<i>person</i>, the very same <i>attitude</i>, which is
made analogous to the <i>circumstance</i> before
specified, and is to suggest it, will, as I said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
be represented by different writers very differently.
<i>Homer</i>, to express <i>the rise or appearance
of this person</i>, speaks of her <i>as
shooting forth from the ocean</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>Virgil, as rising from the rocks of Ida.</i></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Jamque jugis summae surgebat Lucifer Idae,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ducebatque diem.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Shakespear</i> hath closed a fine description of
the morning with the same <i>image</i>, but expressed
in a very different manner.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Look what streaks</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Night’s candles are put out: and</i> <span class="smcap">jocund day</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountains top</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The reader, no doubt, pronounces on first
sight, this description to be <i>original</i>. But
why? There is no part of it, which may not
be traced in other poets. The <i>staining of the
clouds</i>, and <i>putting out the stars</i>, are circumstances,
that are almost constantly taken notice
of in representations of the morning. And
the last <i>image</i>, which strikes most, is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
essentially different from that of Virgil and
Homer. It would express the <i>attitude</i> of a
person impatient, and in act to make his appearance.
And this is, plainly, the <i>image</i>
suggested by the other two. But the difference
lies here. Homer’s <i>expression</i> of this
<i>impatience</i> is <i>general</i>, ΩΡΝΥΘ. So is Virgil’s,
and, as the occasion required, with less
energy, <small>SURGEBAT</small>. Shakespear’s is <i>particular</i>:
that impatience is set before us, and pictured
to the eye in the circumstance of <i>standing
tiptoe</i>; the attitude of a winged messenger, in
act to shoot away on his errand with eagerness
and precipitation. Which is a beauty of the
same kind with that Aristotle so much admired
in the ΡΟΔΟΔΑΚΤΥΛΟΣ of Homer. “This
image, says he, is peculiar and singularly
proper to set the object before our eyes.
Had the poet said ΦΟΙΝΙΚΟΔΑΚΤΥΛΟΣ,
the colour had been signified too <i>generally</i>,
and still worse by ΕΡΥΘΡΟΔΑΚΤΥΛΟΣ.
ΡΟΔΟΔΑΚΤΥΛΟΣ gives the precise idea,
which was wanting<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.”</p>

<p>This, it must be owned, is one of the surest
characteristics of real genius. And if we find
it generally in a writer, we may almost venture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
to esteem him <i>original</i> without further scruple.
For the shapes and appearances of things are
apprehended, only in the gross, by dull minds.
They think they <i>see</i>, but it is as through a mist,
where if they catch but a faint glimpse of the
form before them, it is well. More one is not
to look for from their clouded imaginations.
And what they thus imperfectly discern, it is
not possible for them to delineate very distinctly.
Whereas every object stands forth in
bright sunshine to the view of the true poet.
Every minute mark and lineament of the contemplated
form leaves a corresponding trace
on his fancy. And having these bright and
determinate conceptions of things in his own
mind, he finds it no difficulty to convey the
liveliest ideas of them to others. This is what
we call <i>painting</i> in poetry; by which not only
the general natures of things are described,
and their more obvious appearances shadowed
forth; but every single <i>property</i> marked, and
the poet’s own image set in distinct <i>relief</i> before
the view of his reader.</p>

<p>If this glow of imagery, resulting from clear
and bright perceptions in the poet, be not a
certain character of <i>genius</i>, it will be difficult,
I believe, to say what is: I mean so far as descriptive
poetry, which we are now considering,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
is concerned. The same <i>general</i> appearances
must be copied by all poets; the same <i>particular</i>
circumstances will frequently occur to
all. But to give life and colour to the selected
circumstance, and imprint it on the imagination
with distinctness and vivacity, this is the
proper office of true genius. An ordinary
writer may, by dint of industry, and a careful
study of the best models, sometimes succeed
in this work of <i>painting</i>; that is, having
stolen a ray of celestial matter, he may now
and then direct it so happily, as to animate
and enkindle his own earthly lump; but to
succeed constantly in this art of description, to
be able, on all occasions, to exhibit what the
Greek Rhetoricians call ΦΑΝΤΑΣΙΑΝ; which
is, as Longinus well expresses it, when “the
poet, from his own vivid and enthusiastic
conception, seems to have the object, he describes,
in actual view, and presents it, almost,
to the eyes of the reader<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>;” this can be
accomplished by nothing less, than the genuine
plastic powers of original creation.</p>

<p>2. If from this vast theatre of <i>sensible and
extraneous</i> beauty, the poet turn his attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
to what passes <i>within</i>, he immediately discovers
a new world, invisible indeed and intellectual;
but which is equally capable of being
represented to the internal sense of others.
This arises from that <i>similarity of mind</i>, if I
may so speak, which, like that of outward
<i>form</i> and <i>make</i>, by the wise provision of
nature, runs through the whole species. We
are all furnished with the same original <i>properties
and affections</i>, as with the same stock
of <i>perceptions and ideas</i>; whence it is, that
our intimate consciousness of what we carry
about in ourselves, becomes, as it were, the
interpreter of the poet’s thought; and makes
us readily enter into all his descriptions of the
human nature. These descriptions are of two
kinds; either 1. such as express that tumult
and disorder of the mind, which we feel in
ourselves from the disturbance of any natural
affection: or, 2. that more quiet state, which
gives birth to calmer sentiments and reflexions.
The <i>former</i> division takes in all the workings
of <small>PASSION</small>. The <i>latter</i>, comprehends our
<small>MANNERS</small> and <small>SENTIMENTS</small>. Both are equally
the objects of poetry; and of poetry only,
which triumphs without a rival, in this most
sublime and interesting of all the modes of
<i>imitation</i>. Painting, we know, can express
the <i>material universe</i>; and, as will be seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
hereafter, can evidence the internal movements
of the soul by <i>sensible marks and symbols</i>;
but it is poetry alone, which delineates the
mind itself, and opens the recesses of the heart
to us.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Effert animi motus interprete lingua.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now the poet, as I said, in addressing himself
to this province of his art, hath only to
consult with his own conscious reflexion.
Whatever be the situation of the persons,
whom he would make known to us, let him
but take counsel of his own heart<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>, and it will
very faithfully suggest the fittest and most
natural expressions of their character. No
man can describe of others further than he
hath <i>felt</i> himself. And what he hath thus
known from his own <i>feeling</i> is so consonant
to the experience of all others, that his
description must needs be <i>true</i>; that is, be
the very same, which a careful attention to
such experience must have dictated to every
other. So that, instead of asking one’s self
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
(as an admired ancient advised to do) on any
attempt to excel in composition, “how this or
that celebrated author would have written on
the occasion;” the surer way, perhaps, is to
inquire of ourselves “how we have <i>felt</i> or
<i>thought</i> in such a conjuncture, what <i>sensations</i>
or <i>reflexions</i> the like circumstances
have actually excited in us.” For the
answer to these queries will undoubtedly set us
in the direct road of nature and common sense.
And, whatever is thus taken from the <i>life</i>, will,
we may be sure, affect other minds, in proportion
to the vigour of our conception and
expression of it. In sum,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>To catch the manners living, as they rise</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I mean, from our own internal frame and constitution,
is the sole way of writing naturally
and justly of human life. And every such
description of <i>ourselves</i> (the great exemplar of
<i>moral imitation</i>) will be as unavoidably similar
to any description copied on the like occasion,
by other poets; as pictures of the <i>natural
world</i> by different hands, are, and must be,
to each other, as being all derived from the
archetype of one common original.</p>

<p>1. Let us take some master-piece of a great
poet, most famed for his original invention, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
which he has successfully revealed the secret
internal workings of any <small>PASSION</small>. What does
he make known of these mysterious powers,
but what he <i>feels</i>? And whence comes the
impression, his description makes on others,
but from its agreement to their <i>feelings</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>? To
instance, in the expression of <i>grief on the
murder of children, relations, friends, &amp;c.</i>
a <i>passion</i>, which poetry hath ever taken a fond
pleasure to paint in all its distresses, and which
our common nature obliges all readers to enter
into with an exquisite sensibility. What are
the tender touches which most affect us on
these occasions? Are they not such as these:
<i>complaints of untimely death</i>: <i>of unnatural
cruelty in the murderer</i>: <i>imprecations of vengeance</i>:
<i>weariness and contempt of life</i>: <i>expostulations
with heaven</i>: <i>fond recollections</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
<i>of the virtues and good qualities of the deceased</i>;
<i>and of the different expectations,
raised by them</i>? These were the dictates of
nature to the <i>father of poets</i>, when he had to
draw the distresses of <i>Priam’s</i> family sorrowing
for the death of Hector. Yet nothing, it
seems, but <i>servile imitation</i> could supply his
sons, the Greek and Roman poets in aftertimes,
with such pathetic lamentations. It
may be so. They were all nourished by his
streams. But what shall we say of one, who
assuredly never drank at his fountains?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>My heart will burst, and if I speak&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Butchers and villains, bloody cannibals,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How sweet a plant have ye untimely cropt!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You have no children; butchers, if you had,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The thought of them would have stirr’d up remorse.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The reader, also, may consult that wonderful
scene, in which <span class="smcap">Macduff</span> laments the murder
of his wife and children. [<span class="smcap">Macbeth.</span>]</p>

<p>2. It is not different with the <small>MANNERS</small>; I
mean those sentiments, which mark and distinguish
<i>characters</i>. These result immediately
from the suggestions of <i>nature</i>; which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
is so uniform in her workings, and offers herself
so openly to common inspection, that
nothing but a perverse and studied affectation
can frequently hinder the exactest similarity
of representation in different writers. This is
so true, that, from knowing the <i>general character</i>,
intended to be kept up, we can guess,
beforehand, how a person will act, or what
sentiments he will entertain, on any occasion.
And the critic even ventures to prescribe, by
the authority of rule, the particular properties
and attributes, required to sustain it. And no
wonder. Every man, as he can make himself
the <i>subject</i> of all passions, so he becomes, in
a manner, the <i>aggregate</i> of all <i>characters</i>.
Nature may have inclined him most powerfully
to one set of <i>manners</i>; just as one <i>passion</i> is,
always, predominant in him. But he finds in
himself the seeds of all others. This consciousness,
as before, furnishes the characteristic
sentiments, which constitute the <i>manners</i>.
And it were full as strange for two
poets, who had taken in hand such a character,
as that of Achilles, to differ materially in their
expression of it; as for two painters, drawing
from the same object, to avoid a striking
conformity in the <i>design</i> and attitude of their
pictures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>Those who are fond of hunting after parallels,
might, I doubt not, with great ease,
confront almost every sentiment, which, in
the Greek tragedians, is made expressive of
particular <i>characters</i>, with similar passages in
other poets; more especially (for I must often
refer to his authority) in the various living
portraitures of <i>Shakespear</i>. Yet he, who
after taking this learned pains, should chuse
to urge such parallels, when found, for proofs
of his <i>imitation of the ancients</i>, would only
run the hazard of being reputed, by men of
sense, as poor a critic of human nature, as of
his author.</p>

<p>I say this with confidence, because I say it
on a great authority. “Tout est dit (says
an exquisite writer on the subject of <i>manners</i>)
et l’on vient trop tard depuis plus de
sept mille ans qu’il y a des hommes, et qui
pensent. Sur ce qui concerne les <small>MOEURS</small>,
le plus beau et le meilleur est enlev&eacute;; l’on ne
fait que glaner apr&egrave;s les anciens, &amp; les
habiles d’entre les modernes<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>.”</p>

<p>Thus far indeed, the case is almost too plain
to be disputed. Strong <i>affections</i>, and constitutional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
<i>characters</i>, will be allowed to act
powerfully and steadily upon us. The violence
and rapidity of their movements render all
disguise impossible. And we find ourselves
determined, by a kind of necessity, to <i>think
and speak</i>, in given circumstances, after much
the same manner. But what shall we say of
our cooler reasonings; the <i>sentiments</i>, which
the mind, at pleasure, revolves, and applies, as
it sees fit, to various occasions? “Fancy and
humour, it will be thought, have so great an
influence in directing these operations of our
mental faculties, as to make it altogether
incredible, that any remarkable coincidence
of sentiment, in different persons, should
result from them.”</p>

<p>To think of reducing the thoughts of man,
which are “<i>more than the sands, and wider
than the ocean</i>,” into classes, were, perhaps, a
wild attempt. Yet the most considerable of
those, which enter into works of poetry (besides
such as result from fixed <i>characters</i> or
predominant <i>passions</i>) may be included in the
division of 1. <i>Religious</i>, 2. <i>Moral</i>, and 3.
<i>Oeconomical</i> sentiments; understanding by
this <i>last</i> (for I know of no fitter term to express
my meaning) all those <i>reasonings</i>, which
take their rise from <i>particular conjunctures of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
<i>ordinary life, and are any way relative to our
conduct in it</i>.</p>

<p>1. The apprehension of some invisible
power, as superintending the universe, tho’
not <i>connate</i> with the mind, yet, from the experience
of all ages, is found inseparable from
the first and rudest exertions of its powers.
And the several reflexions, which religion derives
from this <i>idea</i>, are altogether as necessary.
It is easy to conceive, how unavoidably,
almost, the mind awakened by certain conjunctures
of <i>distress</i>, and working on the
ground of this original <i>impression</i>, turns itself
to awful views of deity, and seeks relief in
those soothing contemplations of Providence,
which we find so frequent in the <i>epic</i> and
<i>tragic</i> poets. And whoever shall give himself
the trouble of examining those noble <i>hymns</i>,
which the <i>lyric</i> muse, in her gravest humours,
chaunted to the popular gods of paganism,
will hardly find a single trace of a devotional
sentiment, which hath not been common, at
all times, to all <i>religionists</i>. Their <i>power</i>,
and sovereign <i>disposal of all events</i>; their
<i>care of the good</i>, and <i>aversion to the wicked</i>;
the blessings, they derive on their <i>worshippers</i>,
and the terrors, they infix in the breasts of the
<i>profane</i>; they are the usual topics of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
meditations; the solemn sentiments, that consecrate
these addresses to their local, gentilitial
deities. In listening to these divine strains
every one <i>feels</i>, from his own consciousness,
how necessary such reflexions are to human
nature; more particularly, when to the simple
apprehension of <i>deity</i>, a warm <i>fancy</i> and
strong <i>affections</i> join their combined powers,
to push the mind forward into enthusiastic
raptures. All the faculties of the soul being
then upon the stretch, natural ability holds the
place, and, in some sort, doth the office, of
divine suggestion. And, bating the impure
mixture of their fond and senseless <i>traditions</i>,
one is not surprized to find a strong resemblance,
oftentimes, in point of <i>sentiment</i>, betwixt
these pagan odes, and the genuine inspirations
of Heaven. Let not the reader be
scandalized at this bold comparison. It affirms
no more, than what the gravest authors have
frequently shewn, a manifest analogy between
the sacred and prophane poets; and which
supposes only, that Heaven, when it infuses its
own light into the breasts of men, doth not
extinguish <i>that</i> which nature and reason had
before kindled up in them. It follows, that
either <i>succeeding</i> poets are not necessarily to
be accused of stealing their religious sentiments
from their elder brethren, or that <span class="smcap">Orpheus</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
<span class="smcap">Homer</span>, and <span class="smcap">Callimachus</span> may be as reasonably
charged with plundering the sacred
treasures of <span class="smcap">David</span>, and the other Hebrew
prophets.</p>

<p>It is much the same with the <i>illusions</i> of
<i>corrupt</i> religion. The <i>fauns and nymphs</i> of
the ancients, holding their residence in shadowy
groves or caverns, and the frightful
spectres of their <i>Larvae</i>: to which we may
oppose the modern visions of <i>fairies</i>; and of
<i>ghosts</i>, gliding through church-yards, and
haunting sepulchres; together with the vast
train of gloomy reflexions, which so naturally
wait upon them, are, as well as the juster
notions of divinity, the genuine offspring of
the same <i>common apprehensions</i>. Reason,
when misled by superstition, takes a <i>certain
route</i>, and keeps as steadily in it, as when
conducted by a sound and sober piety. There
needs only a previous conception of unseen
<i>intelligence</i> for the ground-work; and the
timidity of human nature, amidst the nameless
terrors, which are everywhere presenting themselves
to the suspicious eye of ignorance, easily
builds upon it the entire fabrick of superstitious
thinking. With the poets all this goes under
the common name of <small>RELIGION</small>. For they are
concerned only to represent the opinions and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
conclusions, to which the <i>idea</i> of divinity
leads. And these, we now see, they derive
from their own <i>experience</i>, or the received
<i>theology</i> of the times, of which they write.
<i>Religious sentiments</i> being, then, universally,
either the obvious deductions of human reason,
in the easiest exercise of its powers, or the
plain matter of simple observation, regarding
what passes before us in real life, how can
they but be the <i>same</i> in different writers,
though perfectly <i>original</i>, and holding no
correspondence with each other?</p>

<p>2. And the same is true of our <i>moral</i>, as
<i>religious</i> sentiments. Whole volumes, indeed,
have been written to shew, that all our
commonest notices of <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i> have
been traduced from ancient tradition, founded
on express supernatural communication. With
writers of this turn the <i>gnomae</i> of paganism,
even the slightest moral sentiments of the most
original ancients, spring from this source. If
any exception were allowed, one should suppose
it would be in favour of the <i>father of
poetry</i>, whose writings all have agreed to set
up as the very prodigy of human invention.
And yet a very learned Professor<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> (to pass over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
many slighter Essays) hath compiled a large
work of Homer’s moral <i>parallelisms</i>; that is,
ethic sentences, confronted with similar ones
out of sacred writ. The correspondency, it
seems, appeared so striking to this learned
person, that he was in doubt, if this great
original thinker had not drawn from the fountains
of <i>Siloam</i>, instead of <i>Castalis</i>. Whereas
the whole, which these studied collections
prove to plain sense, perverted by no bias of
false zeal or religious prepossession, is, that
reason, or provident nature, has inscribed the
same legible characters of <i>moral</i> truth on all
minds; and that the beauties of the <i>moral</i>, as
<i>natural</i> world lie open to the view of all observers.
This, if it were not too plain to need
insisting upon, might be further shewn from
the <i>similarity</i>, which hath constantly been
observed in the <i>law</i> and <i>moral</i> of all states and
countries; as well the uninformed, and far
distant regions of barbarism, as those happier
climates, on which, from the neighbourhood
of their situation, and the curiosity of inquiry,
some beams of this celestial light may be
thought to have glanced.</p>

<p>3. For what concerns the class of <i>oeconomical
sentiments</i>; or such prudential conclusions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
as offer themselves on certain conjunctures
of ordinary life, these, it is plain, depending
very much on the free exercise of our
reasoning powers, will be more variable and
uncertain, than any other. When the mind
is at leisure to cast about and amuse itself with
reflexions, which no <i>characteristic quality</i>
dictates, or <i>affection</i> extorts, and which spring
from no preconceived system of <i>moral or religious</i>
opinions, a greater latitude of thinking
is allowed; and consequently any remarkable
correspondency of <i>sentiment</i> affords more room
for suspicion of <i>imitation</i>. Yet, in any supposed
combination of circumstances, one train
of thought is, generally, most obvious, and
occurs soonest to the understanding; and, it
being the office of poetry to present the most
<i>natural</i> appearances, one cannot be much
surprized to find a frequent coincidence of
reflexion even here. The first page one opens
in any writer will furnish examples. The
duke in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, upon hearing
some petty slanders thrown out against himself,
falls into this trite reflexion:</p>

<p>Friar Lawrence, in <i>Romeo</i> and <i>Juliet</i>, observing

<p>Now what is it, in prejudice to the originality

<p>It were easy to multiply examples, but I
spare the reader. Though nothing may seem,
at first sight, more inconstant, variable, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
capricious, than the <i>thought</i> of man, yet he
will easily collect, that <i>character</i>, <i>passion</i>,
<i>system</i>, or <i>circumstance</i> can, each in its turn,
by a secret yet sure influence, bind its extravagant
starts and sallies; and effect, at length,
as necessary a conformity in the representation
of these <i>internal movements</i>, as of the visible
phaenomena of the <i>natural world</i>. A poor
impoverished spirit, who has no sources of
invention in himself, may be tempted to relieve
his wants at the expence of his wealthier
neighbour. But the suspicion, of <i>real ability</i>,
is childish. Common sense directs us, for the
most part, to regard <i>resemblances</i> in great
writers, not as the pilferings, or frugal acquisitions
of needy <i>art</i>, but as the honest fruits
of genius, the free and liberal bounties of unenvying
<i>nature</i>.</p>

<p>III. Having learned, from our own conscious
reflexion, the secret operations of <i>reason</i>,
<i>character</i>, and <i>passion</i>, it now remains
to contemplate their <i>effects in visible appearances</i>.
For nature is not more regular and
consistent with herself in touching the fine
and hidden springs of humanity, than in ordering
the outward and grosser movements.
The thoughts and affections of men paint
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
themselves on the <i>countenance</i>; stand forth
in <i>airs</i> and <i>attitudes</i>; and declare themselves
in all the diversities of human <i>action</i>. This is
a new field for mimic genius to range in; a
great and glorious one, and which affords the
noblest and most interesting objects of <i>imitation</i>.
For the external forms themselves are
grateful to the <i>fancy</i>, and, as being expressive
of <i>design</i>, warm and agitate the <i>heart</i> with
passion. Hence it is, that narrative poetry,
which draws mankind under every <i>apparent
consequence and effect</i> of passion, inchants the
mind. And even the dramatic, we know, is
cool and lifeless, and loses half its efficacy,
without <i>action</i>. This, too, is the province of
<i>picture</i>, <i>statuary</i>, and all arts, which inform
by mute signs. Nay, the mute arts may be
styled, almost without a figure, in this class
of <i>imitation</i>, the most eloquent. For what
words can express <i>airs and attitudes</i>, like the
pencil? Or, when the genius of the artists is
equal, who can doubt of giving the preference
to that representation, which, striking on the
sight, grows almost into reality, and is hardly
considered by the inraptured thought, as <i>fiction</i>?
When <i>passion</i> is to be made known by
outward <i>act</i>, Homer himself yields the palm
to <i>Raphael</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>But our business is with the <i>poets</i>. And,
in reviewing this their largest and most favoured
stock of <i>materials</i>, can we do better
than contemplate them in the very order, in
which we before disposed the <i>workings</i> of the
mind itself, the <i>causes</i> of these appearances?</p>

<p>1. To begin with the <i>affections</i>. They have
their rise, as was observed, from the very
<i>constitution</i> of human nature, when placed in
given circumstances, and acted upon by certain
occurrences. The perceptions of these inward
commotions are uniformly the same, in all;
and draw along with them the same, or similar
<i>sentiments and reflexions</i>. Hence the appeal
is made to every one’s own <i>consciousness</i>,
which declares the truth or falshood of the
<i>imitation</i>. When these <i>commotions</i> are produced
and made objective to sense by <i>visible
signs</i>, is <i>observation</i> a more fallible guide,
than <i>consciousness</i>? Or, doth experience
attest these <i>signs</i> to be less similar and uniform,
than their <i>occasions</i>? By no means.
Take a man under the impression of <i>joy</i>, <i>fear</i>,
<i>grief</i>, or any other of the stronger affections;
and see, if a peculiar conformation of feature,
some certain stretch of muscle, or contortion
of limb, will not necessarily follow, as the
clear and undoubted index of his condition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Our natural curiosity is ever awake and attentive
to these <i>changes</i>. And poetry sets herself
at work, with eagerness, to catch and transcribe
their various <i>appearances</i>. No correspondency
of representation, then, needs
surprize us; nor any the exactest <i>resemblance</i>
be thought strange, where the <i>object</i> is equally
present to all persons. For it must be remarked
of the <i>visible effects</i> of <small>MIND</small>, as, before,
of the <i>phaenomena</i> of the <i>material world</i>,
that they are, simply, the objects of <i>observation</i>.
So that what was concluded of <i>these</i>,
will hold also of the <i>others</i>; with this difference,
that the <i>effects of internal movements</i>
do not present themselves so <i>constantly</i> to the
eye, nor with that <i>uniformity</i> of appearance,
as <i>permanent, external existencies</i>. We cannot
survey them at <i>pleasure</i>, but as occasion
offers: and we, further, find them diversified
by the <i>character</i>, or disguised, in some degree,
by the <i>artifice</i>, of the persons, in whom we
observe them. But all the consequence is,
that, to succeed in this work of painting the
<i>signatures of internal affection</i>, requires a
larger experience, or quicker penetration, than
copying after <i>still life</i>. Where the proper
qualifications are possessed, and especially in
describing the <i>marks</i> of vigorous affections,
different writers cannot be supposed to vary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
more considerably, in <i>this</i> province of <i>imitation</i>,
than in the <i>other</i>. Our trouble therefore,
on this head, may seem to be at an end. Yet
it will be expected, that so general a conclusion
be inforced by some <i>illustrations</i>.</p>

<p>The passion of <small>LOVE</small> is one of those affections,
which bear great sway in the human
nature. Its <i>workings</i> are violent. And its
<i>effects</i> on the person, possessed by it, and in
the train of events, to which it gives occasion,
conspicuous to all observers. The power of
this commanding affection hath triumphed at
all times. It hath given birth to some of the
greatest and most signal transactions in <i>history</i>;
and hath furnished the most inchanting scenes
of <i>fiction</i>. Poetry hath ever lived by it. The
modern muse hath hardly any existence without
it. Let us ask, then, of this <i>tyrant passion</i>,
whether its operations are not too familiar
to <i>sense</i>, its <i>effects</i> too visible to the <i>eye</i>, to
make it necessary for the poet to go beyond
himself, and the sphere of his own observation,
for the <i>original</i> of his descriptions of it.</p>

<p>To prevent all cavil, let it be allowed, that
the <i>signs</i> of this passion, I mean, the visible
effects in which it shews itself, are various and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
almost infinite. It is reproached, above all
others, with the names of <i>capricious, fantastic,
and unreasonable</i>. No wonder then, if it
assume an endless variety of forms, and seem
impatient, as it were, of any certain shape or
posture. Yet this Proteus of a passion may
be fixed by the magic hand of the poet.
Though it can <i>occasionally</i> take <i>all</i>, yet it
delights to be seen in <i>some</i> shapes, more than
others. Some of its <i>effects</i> are known and
obvious, and are perpetually recurring to observation.
And these are ever fittest to the
ends of poetry; every man pronouncing of
such representations from his proper experience,
that they are from <i>nature</i>. Nay its
very irregularities may be reduced to rule.
There is not, in antiquity, a truer picture of
this fond and froward passion, than is given
us in the person of Terence’s <i>Phaedria</i> from
Menander. <i>Horace</i> and <i>Persius</i>, when they
set themselves, on purpose, to expose and
exaggerate its follies, could imagine nothing
beyond it. Yet we have much the same inconsistent
character in <span class="smcap">Julia</span> in <i>The two Gentlemen
of Verona</i>.</p>

<p>Shall it be now said, that <i>Shakespear</i> copied
from Terence, as Terence from Menander?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Or is it not as plain to common sense, that
the English poet is <i>original</i>, as that the <i>Latin</i>
poet was an <i>imitator</i>?</p>

<p><i>Shakespear</i>, on another occasion, describes
the various, external symptoms of this extravagant
affection. Amongst others, he insists,
there is no surer sign of being in love, “<i>than
when every thing about you demonstrates a
careless desolation</i>.” [<i>As you like it.</i> A.
iii. Sc. 8.] Suppose now the poet to have
taken in hand the story of a neglected, abandoned
lover; for instance of Ariadne; a story,
which ancient poetry took a pleasure to relate,
and which hath been touched with infinite
grace by the tender, passionate muse of Catullus
and Ovid. Suppose him to give a portrait
of her <i>passion</i> in that distressful moment
when, “<i>from the naked beach, she views the
parting sail of Theseus</i>.” This was a time
for all the signs of <i>desolation</i> to shew themselves.
And could we doubt of his describing
those <i>very signs</i>, which nature’s self dictated,
long ago, to Catullus?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Non flavo retinens subtilem vertice mitram,</i><br /></span>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>But there is a higher instance in view. The
humanity and easy elegance of the two Latin
poets, just mentioned, joined to an unaffected
<i>naivet&egrave;</i> of expression, were, perhaps, most
proper to describe the petulancies, the caprices,
the softnesses of this passion in common life.
To paint its tragic and more awful distresses,
to melt the soul into all the sympathies of sorrow,
is the peculiar character of Virgil’s poetry.
His talents were, indeed, universal. But, I
think, we may give it for the characteristic of
his muse, that she was, beyond all others,
possessed of a sovereign power of touching the
tender passions. Euripides’ self, whose genius
was most resembling to his, of all the ancients,
holds, perhaps, but the second place in this
praise.</p>

<p>A poet, thus accomplished, would omit, we
may be sure, no occasion of yielding to his
natural bias of recording the distresses of <i>love</i>.
He discovered his talent, as well as inclination,
very early, in the <i>Bucolics</i>; and even, where
one should least expect it, in his <i>Georgics</i>.
But the fairest opportunity offered in his great
design of the <i>Aeneis</i>. Here, one should suppose,
the whole bent of his genius would exert
itself. And we are not disappointed. I speak
not of that succession of <i>sentiments, reflexions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and expostulations</i>, which flow, as in a continued
stream of grief, from the first discovery
of her heart to her sister, to her last frantic
and inflamed resentments. These belong to
the former article of <i>internal movements</i>: and
need not be considered. My concern at present,
is with those <i>visible, external indications</i>,
the sensible marks and signatures (as expressed
in <i>look</i>, <i>air</i>, and <i>action</i>) of this tormenting
frenzy. The history of these, as related in the
narrative part of Dido’s adventure, would comprehend
every natural <i>situation</i> of a person,
under <i>love’s</i> distractions. And it were no unpleasing
amusement to follow and contemplate
her, in a series of pictures, from her first
attitude, of <i>hanging on the mouth of Aeneas</i>,
through all the gradual excesses of her rage,
to the concluding fatal <i>act of desperation</i>.
But they are deeply imprinted on every schoolboy’s
memory. It need only be observed,
that they are such, as almost necessarily spring
up from the circumstances of her case, and
which every reader, on first view, as agreeing
to his own notices and observations, pronounces
<i>natural</i>.</p>

<p>It may seem sufficient, therefore, to ascribe
these portraitures of passion, so suitable to all
our expectations, and in drawing which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
genius of the great poet so eminently excelled,
to the original hand and design of Virgil. But
the perverse humour of criticism, occasioned
by this inveterate prejudice “of taking all <i>resemblances</i>
for <i>thefts</i>,” will allow no such
thing. Before it will decide of this matter,
every ancient writer, who but incidentally
touches a love-adventure, must be sought out
and brought in evidence against him. And
finding that <i>Homer</i> hath his Calypso, and
<i>Euripides</i> and <i>Apollonius</i> their Medea, it
adjudges the entire episode to be stolen by
piece-meal, and patched up out of their
writings. I have a learned critic now before
me, who roundly asserts, “that, but for the
Argonautics, there had been no fourth book
of the Aeneis<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>.” Some traits of resemblance
there are. It could not be otherwise. But
all the use a candid reader, who comes to his
author with the true spirit of a critic, will make
of them, is to shew, “how justly the poet
copies nature, which had suggested similar
representations to his predecessors.”</p>

<p>What is here concluded of the <i>softer</i>, cannot
but hold more strongly of the <i>boisterous</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
passions. These do not shelter, and conceal
themselves within the man. It is particularly,
of their nature, to stand forth, and shew
themselves in <i>outward actions</i>. Of the more
illustrious <i>effects</i> of the ruder passions the
chief are <i>contentions and wars</i>&mdash;<i>regum &amp; populorum
aestus</i>; which, by reason of the
grandeur of the subject, and its important
consequences, so fitted to strike the thought,
and fire the affections of the reader, poetry, I
mean the highest and sublimest species of it,
chuses principally to describe. In the conduct
of such <i>description</i>, some difference will arise
from the instruments in use for annoyance of
the enemy, and, in general, the state of <i>art
military</i>; but the actuating passions of <i>rage</i>,
<i>ambition</i>, <i>emulation</i>, <i>thirst of honour</i>, <i>revenge</i>,
&amp;c. are invariably the same, and are
constantly evidenced by the same external
marks or characters. The <i>shocks of armies</i>,
<i>single combats</i>; <i>the chances and singularities
of either</i>; <i>wounds</i>, <i>deaths</i>, <i>stratagems</i>, and
the other attendants on <i>battle</i>, which furnish
out the state and magnificence of the epic
muse, are, all of them, <i>fixed, determinate
objects</i>; which leave their impressions on the
mind of the poet, in as distinct and uniform
characters, as the great constituent parts of the
material universe itself. He hath only to look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
abroad into <i>life and action</i> for the model of
all such representations. On which account
we can rarely be certain, that the <i>picture</i> is
not from <i>nature</i>, though an exact resemblance
give to superficial and unthinking observers the
suspicion of <i>art</i>.</p>

<p>The same reasoning extends to all the <i>phaenomena</i>
of human life, which are the effects
or consequences of <i>strong affections</i>, and
which set mankind before us in <i>gestures</i>, <i>looks</i>,
or <i>actions</i>, declarative of the inward suggestions
of the heart. It can seldom be affirmed
with confidence, in such cases, on the score
of any similarity, that one representation <i>imitates</i>
another; since an ordinary attention to
the same common original, sufficiently accounts
for both. The reader, if he sees fit,
will apply these remarks to the <i>battles</i>, <i>games</i>,
<i>travels</i>, &amp;c. of a great poet; the supposed
sterility of whose genius hath been charged
with serving itself pretty freely of the copious,
inexhausted stores of Homer. In sum;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quicquid agunt homines, votum, timor, ira, voluptas,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gaudia, &amp;c.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whatever be the <i>actuating passion</i>, it cannot
but be thought unfair to suspect the artist of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
<i>imitation</i>; where nothing more is pretended
than a <i>resemblance</i> in the draught of <i>similar
effects</i>, which it is not possible to avoid.</p>

<p>2. If this be comprehended, I shall need to
say the less of the <small>MANNERS</small>; which are not
less constant in their <i>effects</i>, than the <small>PASSIONS</small>.
When the <i>character</i> of any person hath been
signified, and his situation described, it is not
wonderful, that twenty different writers should
hit on the same <i>attitudes</i>, or employ him in the
same manner. When Mercury is sent to
command the departure of Ulysses from Calypso,
our previous acquaintance with the
hero’s character makes us expect to find him
in the precise <i>attitude</i>, given to him by the
poet, “sitting in solitude on the sea-shore, and
casting a wishful eye towards Ithaca.” Or,
when, in the Iliad, an embassy is dispatched
to treat with the resentful and vindictive, but
brave Achilles, nothing could be more obvious
than to draw the pupil of Chiron in his tent
“soothing his angry soul with his harp, and
singing</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Th’ immortal deeds of heroes and of kings</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was the like attention to <i>nature</i>, which led
Milton to dispose of his fallen angels after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the manner, described in the second book of
<i>Paradise lost</i>.</p>

<p>To multiply instances, when every poet in
every page is at hand to furnish them, were
egregious trifling. In all cases of this sort, the
<i>known character</i>, in conjunction with the
<i>circumstances</i> of the person described, determines
the particular <i>action</i> or <i>employment</i>, for
the most part, so absolutely, that it requires
some industry to mistake it. In saying which,
I do not forget, what many have, perhaps,
been ready to object to me long since, “that
what is <i>natural</i> is not therefore of necessity
<i>obvious</i>: All the amazing flights of Homer’s
or Shakespear’s fancy are found agreeable to
nature, when contemplated by the capable
reader; but who will say, that, therefore,
they must have presented themselves to the
generality of writers? The office of <i>judgment</i>
is one thing, and of <i>invention</i>, another.”</p>

<p>Properly speaking, what we call <i>invention</i>
in poetry is, in respect of the <i>matter</i> of it,
simply, <i>observation</i>. And it is in the arrangement,
use, and application of his <i>materials</i>,
not in the investigation of them, that the exercise
of the poet’s genius principally consists.
In the case of immediate and direct <i>imagery</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
which is the subject at present, nothing more
is requisite, than to paint truly, what nature
presents to the eye, or common sense suggests
to the mind of the writer. A vivacity of
thought will, indeed, be necessary to run over
the several circumstances of any <i>appearance</i>,
and a just discernment will be wanting, out
of a number, to select such peculiar circumstances,
as are most adapted to strike the
imagination. It is not therefore pretended,
that the same images <i>must</i> occur to all. Sluggish,
unactive understandings, which seldom
look abroad into living nature, or, when they
do, have not curiosity or vigour enough to
direct their attention to the nicer particularities
of her beauties, will unavoidably overlook the
commonest appearances: Or, wanting that
just perception of what is <i>beautiful</i>, which we
call <i>taste</i>, will as often mistake in the <i>choice</i>
of those circumstances, which they may have
happened to contemplate. But quick, perceptive,
intelligent minds (and of such only I
can be thought to speak) will hardly fail of
seeing nature in the same light, and of noting
the same distinct features and proportions.
The superiority of Homer and Shakespear to
other poets doth not lie in their discovery of
<i>new sentiments or images</i>, but in the forceable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
manner, in which their sublime genius taught
them to convey and impress <i>old ones</i>.</p>

<p>And to inforce what is here said of the <i>familiarity</i>
of this class of the poet’s materials,
one may, further, appeal to the case of the
other <i>mimetic</i> arts, which have no assistance
from <i>narration</i>. Certain <i>gestures</i>, <i>looks</i>, or
<i>attitudes</i>, are so immediately declarative of
the <i>internal actuating causes</i>, that, on the
slightest view of the <i>picture</i> or <i>statue</i>, we
collect the real state of the persons represented.
This <i>figure</i>, we say, strongly expresses the
passion of <i>grief</i>; <i>that</i>, of <i>anger</i>; <i>that</i>, of
<i>joy</i>; and so of all the other affections. Or,
again, when the particular <i>passion</i> is characterized,
the general temper and disposition,
which we call the <i>manners</i>, is clearly discernible.
There is a liberal and graceful air,
which discovers a fine temperature of the
affections, in <i>one</i>; a close and sullen aspect,
declaring a narrow contracted selfishness in
<i>another</i>. In short, there is scarcely any mark
or feature of the human mind, any peculiarity
of disposition or <i>character</i>, which the artist
does not set off and make appear at once, to
the view, by some certain turn or <i>conformation</i>
of the outward figure. Now this effect of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
<i>art</i> would be impossible, were it not, that
regular and constant observation hath found
such <i>external signs</i> consociated with the correspondent
<i>internal workings</i>. A <i>heaven
overhung with clouds</i>, the <i>tossing of waves</i>,
and <i>intermingled flashes of lightning</i> are not
surer indications of a <i>storm</i>, than the <i>gloomy
face</i>, <i>distorted limb</i>, and <i>indignant eye</i> are
of the outrage of conflicting <i>passion</i>. The
simplest spectator is capable of observing this.
And the artist deceives himself, or would
reflect a false honour on his art, who suspects
there is any mystery in making such
discoveries.</p>

<p>It is true, some great painters have thought
it convenient to explain the design of their
works by <i>inscriptions</i>. We find this expedient
to have been practised of old by Polygnotus,
as may be gathered from the description
given us, of two of his pictures by Pausanias;
and the same thing is observable of some of
the best modern masters. But their intention
was only to signify the names of the principal
persons, and to declare the general scope of
their pictures. And so far, this usage may not
be amiss in large compositions, and especially
on new or uncommon subjects. But should
an artist borrow the assistance of words to tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
us the meaning of <i>airs and attitudes</i>, and to
interpret to us the <i>expression</i> of each figure,
such a piece of intelligence must needs be
thought very impertinent; since they must be
very unqualified to pass their judgment on
works of this sort, who had not, from their
own observation, collected the <i>visible signs</i>,
usually attendant on any <i>character</i> or <i>passion</i>;
and whom therefore the representation of these
<i>signs</i>, would not lead to a certain knowledge
of the character or passion <i>intended</i>.</p>

<p>Nay there is one advantage which <i>painting</i>
hath, in this respect, over <i>narration</i>, and
even <i>poetry</i> itself. For though poetry represent
the <i>same</i> objects, the <i>same</i> sensible marks
of the internal movements, as painting, yet it
doth it with less <i>particularity and exactness</i>.
My meaning will be understood in reflecting,
that <i>words</i> can only give us, even when most
expressive, the <i>general</i> image. The pencil
touches its smallest and minutest <i>specialities</i>.
And this will explain the reason why any remarkable
correspondency of <i>air</i>, <i>feature</i>, <i>attitude</i>,
&amp;c. in two pictures, will, commonly
and with good reason, convict one or both of
them of <i>imitation</i>: whereas this conclusion is
by no means so certain from a correspondency
of description in two poems. For the odds are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
prodigious against such exactness of similitude,
when the slightest trace of the pencil forms a
sensible difference: But poets, who do not
convey ideas with the same precision and distinctness,
cannot be justly liable to this imputation,
even where the general image represented
happens to be the same. Virgil, one
would think, on a very affecting occasion,
might have given the following representation
of his hero,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Multa gemens largoque humectat flumine vultum</i>;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>without any suspicion of communicating with
Homer, who had said, in like manner, of his,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ἵστατο δακρυχέων, ὥστε κρήνη μελάνυδρος.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But had two painters, in presenting this
image, agreed in the same particularities of <i>posture</i>,
<i>inclination of the head</i>, <i>air of the face</i>,
&amp;c. no one could doubt a moment, that the
one was stolen from the other. Which single
observation, if attended to, will greatly abate
the prejudice, usually entertained on this subject.
We think it incredible, amidst the infinite
diversity of the poet’s materials, that any
two should accord in the choice of the very
<i>same</i>; more especially when described with
the same <i>circumstances</i>. But we forget, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the same materials are left in common to <i>all</i>
poets, and that the very <i>circumstances</i>, alledged,
can be, in <i>words</i>, but very generally
and imperfectly delineated.</p>

<p>3, Of the <i>calmer sentiments</i>, which come
within the province of poetry, and, breaking
forth into outward act, furnish matter to description,
the most remarkable in their operations
are those of <i>religion</i>. It is certain, that
the principal of those rites and ceremonies,
of those outward acts of homage, which have
prevailed in different ages and countries, and
constituted the <i>public religion</i> of mankind,
had their rise in our common nature, and were
the genuine product of the workings of the
human mind<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>. For it is the mere illusion of
this inveterate error concerning <i>imitation</i>, in
general, which hath misled some great names
to imagine them traductive from each other.
But the occasion does not require us to take
the matter so deep. The office of poetry, in
describing the solemnity of her religious ritual
is to look no farther, than the established
modes of the age and country, whose manners
it would represent. If these should be the
same at different times in two religions, or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
religion itself continue unchanged, it necessarily
follows, that the representations of them
by different writers will agree to the minutest
resemblance. Not only the general <i>rite</i> or
<i>ceremony</i> will be the same; but the very peculiarities
of its performance, which are prescribed
by rule, remain unaltered. Thus, if
<i>religious sentiments</i> usually express themselves,
in <i>all</i> men, by a certain <i>posture of the
body</i>, <i>direction of the hands</i>, <i>turn of the
countenance</i>, &amp;c. these <i>signs</i> are uniformly
and faithfully pictured in all devotional portraits.
So again, if by the genius of any <i>particular</i>
religion, to which the poet is carefully
to adhere, the practice of <i>sacrifices</i>, <i>auguries</i>,
<i>omens</i>, <i>lustrations</i>, &amp;c. be required in its
established ceremonial, the draught of this
diversity of <i>superstitions</i>, and of their minutest
particulars, will have a necessary place in any
work, professing to delineate such religion;
whatever resemblance its descriptions may be
foreseen to have to those of any other.</p>

<p>The reader will proceed to apply these remarks,
where he sees fit. For it may scarcely
seem worth while to take notice of the insinuation,
which a polite writer, but no very able
critic, hath thrown out against the entire use
of <i>religious description</i> in poetry. I say the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
<i>entire use</i>; for so I understand him, when he
says, “the <i>religion</i> of the gentiles had been
woven into the contexture of all the ancient
poetry with a very <i>agreeable</i> mixture, which
made the moderns <i>affect</i> to give that of
Christianity a place also in their poems<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>.”
He seems not to have conceived, that the <i>visible
effects</i> of religious opinions and dispositions,
constitute a principal part of what is
most striking in the sublimer poetry. The
<i>narrative species</i> delights in, or rather cannot
subsist without, these solemn pictures of the
religious ritual; and the theatre is never more
moved, than when its awful scenery is exhibited
in the <i>dramatic</i>. Or, if he meant this
censure, of the <i>intervention of superior agents</i>,
and what we call <i>machinery</i>, the observation
(though it be seconded by one, whose profession
should have taught him much better<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>) is
not more to the purpose. For the pomp of
the <i>epic muse</i> demands to be furnished with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
train of these celestial personages. Intending,
as she doth, to astonish the imagination with
whatever is most august within the compass
of human thought, it is not possible for her
to accomplish this great end, but by the ministry
of supernatural intelligences, <small>PER AMBAGES
ET MINISTERIA DEORUM</small>.</p>

<p>Or, the proof of these two points may be
given more precisely thus: “The relation of
man to the deity, being as essential to his
nature, as that which he bears to his fellow-citizens,
<i>religion</i> becomes as necessary a
part of a serious and sublime narration of
human life, as <i>civil actions</i>. And as the
sublime nature of it requires even <i>virtues
and vices</i> to be personified, much more is it
necessary, that <i>supernatural agency</i> should
bear a part in it. For, whatever some <i>sects</i>
may think of religion’s being a divine philosophy
in the mind, the <i>poet</i> must exhibit
man’s addresses to Heaven in <i>ceremonies</i>,
and Heaven’s intervention by <i>visible
agency</i>.”</p>

<p>So that the intermixture of religion, in every
point of view, is not only <i>agreeable</i>, but
necessary to the very genius of, at least, the
highest class of poetry. Ancients and moderns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
might therefore be led to the display of this
<i>sacred scenery</i>, without <i>affectation</i>. And for
what concerns <i>Christian poets</i>, in particular,
we see from an instance at home (whatever may
be the success of some Italians, whom he appears
to have had in his eye) that, where the
subject is proper to receive it, it can appear with
as much <i>grace</i>, as in the <i>poets of paganism</i>. It
may be concluded then, universally, that <i>religion</i>
is the proper object of poetry, which
wants no prompter of a preceding model to
give it an introduction; and that the <i>forms</i>,
under which it presents itself, are too manifest
and glaring to observation, to escape any
writer.</p>

<p>The case is somewhat different with what
I call the <i>moral and oeconomical sentiments</i>.
These operate indeed <i>within</i>, and by their busy
and active powers administer abundant matter
to poetic description, which <i>alone</i> is equal to
these <i>unseen workings</i>. For their actings on
the body are too feeble to produce any visible
alteration of the outward form. Their fine
and delicate movements are to be apprehended
only and surveyed by conscious attentive reflexion.
They are not, usually, of force
enough to wield the machine of man; to discompose
his frame, or distort his feature: and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
so rarely come to be susceptible of <i>picture</i> or
<i>representation</i>. One may compare the subtle
operations of these <i>sentiments</i> on the human
form, to the gentle breathing of the air on the
face of nature. Its soft aspirations may be
perceived; its nimble and delicate spirit may
diffuse itself through <i>woods</i> and <i>fields</i>, and its
pervading influence cherish and invigorate all
<i>animal</i> or <i>vegetative being</i>. Yet no external
signs evidence its <i>effects</i> to sense. It acts
invisibly, and therefore no power of imitation
can give it <i>form</i> and <i>colouring</i>. Its impulses
must, at least, have a certain degree of strength:
it must <i>wave</i> the grass, <i>incline</i> trees, and
<i>scatter</i> leaves, before the painter can lay hold
of it, and draw it into <i>description</i>. Just so
it is with our <i>calmer sentiments</i>. They seldom
stir or disorder the human frame. They
spring up casually, and as circumstances concur,
within us; but, as it were, sink and die
away again, like passing gales, without leaving
any impress or mark of violence behind them.
In short, when they do not grow out of <i>fixed
characters</i>, or are prompted by <i>passion</i>, they
do not, I believe, ever make themselves visible.</p>

<p>And this observation reaches as well to <i>event
and action</i> in life, as to the <i>corporal figure</i> of
the person in whom they operate. The sentiments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
here spoken of, however naturally or
even necessarily they may occur to the mind
on certain occasions, yet have seldom or never
any immediate effect on consequent action.
And the reason is, that we do not proceed to
<i>act</i> on the sole conclusions of the understanding;
unless such <i>conclusions</i>, by frequent
meditation, or the co-operating influence of
some affection, excite a ferment in the mind,
and impel the will by <i>passion</i>. Such moral
aphorisms as these, “<i>that friendship is the
medicine of life</i>,” and, “<i>that our country,
as including all other interests, claims our
first regard</i>,” though likely to obtrude
themselves upon us on a thousand occasions,
yet would never have urged Achilles to such a
train of action, as makes the striking part of
the Iliad; or Ulysses, to that which runs
through the intire Odyssey; if a strong, instinctive
affection in both had not conspired to
produce it. When <i>produced</i> therefore, they
are to be considered as the genuine consequences,
not of these <i>moral sentiments</i>, taken
simply by themselves, but of strong benevolence
of soul, implanted by <i>nature</i>, and
strengthened by <i>habit</i>. They are properly
then, the result of the <i>manners</i>, or <i>passions</i>,
which have been already contemplated. Our
sentiments, merely as such, terminate in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
themselves, and furnish no external apparent
matter to <i>description</i>.</p>

<p>The same conclusion would, it must be
owned, hold of our <i>religious</i>, as <i>moral</i> sentiments,
were we to regard them only in this
view of <i>dispassionate and cool reflexions</i>. For
such reflexions produce no change of <i>feature</i>,
no alteration in the <i>form or countenance</i>, nor
are they necessarily followed by any <i>sensible</i>
demonstration of their power in outward <i>action</i>.
But then it usually happens (which sets
the widest difference between the two cases)
that the <i>one</i>, as respecting an <i>object</i>, whose
very <i>idea</i> interests strongly, and puts all our
faculties in motion, are, almost of necessity,
associated with the impelling causes of <i>affection</i>;
and so express themselves in legible signs
and characters. Whereas the other sentiments,
respecting <i>human nature and its necessities</i>,
are frequently no other than a calm indifferent
survey of common life, unattended with any
<i>emotion</i> or inciting principle of action. Hence
<i>religion</i>, inspiriting all its meditations with
<i>enthusiasm</i>, generally shews itself in <i>outward
signs</i>; whereas we frequently discern no traces,
as necessarily attendant upon <i>moral</i>. Which
<i>difference</i> is worth the noting, were it only
for the sake of seeing more distinctly the vast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
advantage of <i>poetry</i>, above all <i>other modes of imitation</i>.
For <i>these</i>, explaining themselves by
the help of <i>natural media</i>, which present a <i>real
resemblance</i>, are able but imperfectly to describe
<i>religious sentiments</i>; in as much as they express
the <i>general vague disposition</i> only, and
not the precise <i>sentiments themselves</i>. And
in <i>moral</i>, they can frequently give us no <i>image</i>
or representation at all. While <i>poetry</i>, which
tells its meaning by <i>artificial signs</i>, conveys
distinct and clear notices of this class of <i>moral
and religious</i> conceptions, which afford such
mighty entertainment to the human mind.
But it serves to a further purpose, more immediately
relative to the subject of this inquiry.
For these <i>ethic and prudential</i> conclusions,
being seen to produce no immediate <i>effect</i> in
look, attitude, or action, we are to regard them
only in their remoter and less direct consequences,
as influencing, at a distance, the civil
and oeconomical affairs of life.</p>

<p>And in this view they open a fresh field for
<i>imitation</i>; not quite so striking to the spectator,
perhaps, but even larger, than <i>that</i>,
into which religion, with all its multiform
superstitions, before led us. For to these
<i>internal workings</i>, assisted and pushed forward
by the wants and necessities of our nature,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
which set the inventive powers on work, are
ultimately to be referred that vast congeries of
<i>political</i>, <i>civil</i>, <i>commercial</i>, and <i>mechanic</i>
institutions, of those infinite <i>manufactures</i>,
<i>arts</i>, and <i>exercises</i>, which come in to the
relief or embellishment of human life. Add
to these all those nameless <i>events</i> and <i>actions</i>,
which, though determined by no fixed <i>habit</i>,
or leading <i>affection</i>, human prudence, providing
for its security or interests, in certain
circumstances, naturally projects and prescribes.
These are ample materials for <i>description</i>;
and the greater poetry necessarily
comprehends a large share of them. Yet in
all delineations of this sort two things are observable,
1. That in the <i>latter</i>, which are the
pure result of our reasonings concerning expediency,
<i>common sense</i>, in given conjunctures,
often leads to the same measures: As when
<i>Ulysses</i> in Homer disguises himself, for the
sake of coming at a more exact information of
the state of his family; or, when <i>Orestes</i> in
Sophocles does the same, to bring about the
catastrophe of the <i>Electra</i>. 2. In respect of
the <i>former</i> (which is of principal consideration)
the established modes and practices of
life being the proper and only <i>archetype</i>, experience
and common observation cannot fail
of pointing, with the greatest certainty, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
them. So that in the <i>one</i> case different writers
<i>may</i> concur in treating the <i>same</i> matter, in the
<i>other</i>, they <i>must</i>. But this last will bear a
little further illustration.</p>

<p>The critics on Homer have remarked, with
admiration, in him, the almost infinite variety
of images and pictures, taken from the intire
circle of <i>human arts</i>. Whatever the wit of
man had invented for the service or ornament
of society in manual exercises and operations
is found to have a place in his writings. <i>Rural
affairs</i>, in their several branches; the <i>mechanic</i>,
and all the polite arts of <i>sculpture</i>,
<i>painting</i>, and <i>architecture</i>, are occasionally
hinted at in his poems; or, rather, their various
imagery, so far as they were known and
practised in those times, is fully and largely
displayed. Now this, though it shew the
prodigious extent of his observation and diligent
curiosity, which could search through all
the storehouses and magazines of <i>art</i>, for materials
of description, yet is not to be placed
to the score of his superior <i>inventive faculty</i>;
nor infers any thing to the disadvantage of
succeeding poets, whose subjects might oblige
them to the same descriptions; any more than
his vast acquaintance with <i>natural scenery</i>,
in all its numberless appearances, implies a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
want of <i>genius</i> in later imitators, who, if they
ventured, at all, into this province, were
constrained to give us the <i>same unvaried
representations</i>.</p>

<p>The truth, as every one sees, is, briefly,
this. The restless and inquisitive mind of
man had succeeded in the discovery or improvement
of the numberless arts of life.
These, for the convenience of method, are
considered as making a large part of those sensible
external <i>effects</i>, which spring from our
internal <i>sentiments</i> or <i>reasonings</i>. But, though
they ultimately respect those <i>reasonings</i>, as
their source, yet they, in no degree, depend
on the actual exertion of them in the breast of
the poet. He copies only the customs of the
times, of which he writes, that is, the sensible
<i>effects</i> themselves. These are permanent objects,
and may, nay <i>must</i> be the <i>same</i>, whatever
be the ability or genius of the <i>copier</i>. In
short, taken together, they make up what, in
the largest sense of the word, we may call,
with the painters, <i>il costum&egrave;</i>; which though
it be a real excellence scrupulously to observe,
yet it requires nothing more than exact observation
and historical knowledge of <i>facts</i> to
do it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>And now having the various objects of
<i>poetical imitation</i> before us (the greatest part
of which, as appears, <i>must</i>, and the rest <i>may</i>,
occur to the observation of the poet) we come
to this <i>conclusion</i>, which, though it may
startle the <i>parallelist</i>, there seems no method
of eluding, “that of any single <i>image</i> or <i>sentiment</i>,
considered separately and by itself,
it can never be affirmed certainly, hardly
with any shew of reason, merely on account
of its agreement in <i>subject-matter</i> with any
other, that it was copied from it.” If there
be any foundation of this inference, it must,
then be laid, not on the <i>matter</i>, but <small>MANNER</small>
of imitation. But here, again, the subject
branches out into various particulars; which,
to be seen distinctly, will demand a new division,
and require us to proceed with leisure
and attention through it.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The sum of the foregoing <i>article</i> is this.
The <i>objects</i> of imitation, like the <i>materials</i> of
human knowledge, are a common stock, which
experience furnishes to all men. And it is in
the <i>operations</i> of the mind upon them, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the glory of <i>poetry</i>, as of <i>science</i>, consists.
Here the genius of the <i>poet</i> hath room to shew
itself; and from hence alone is the praise of
<i>originality</i> to be ascertained. The fondest
admirer of ancient art would never pretend
that <i>Palladio</i> had copied <i>Vitruvius</i>; merely
from his working with the same materials of
<i>wood</i>, <i>stone</i>, or <i>marble</i>, which this great
master had employed before him. But were
the general <i>design</i> of these two architects the
<i>same</i> in any buildings; were their choice and
arrangement of the smaller <i>members</i> remarkably
similar; were their works conducted in
the same <i>style</i>, and their ornaments finished
in the same <i>taste</i>; every one would be apt to
pronounce on first sight, that the one was
<i>borrowed</i> from the other. Even a correspondency
in any <i>one</i> of these points might
create a suspicion. For what likelihood, amidst
an infinite variety of <i>methods</i>, which offer
themselves, as to <i>each</i> of these particulars,
that there should be found, without <i>design</i>, a
signal concurrence in <i>any one</i>? ’Tis then in
the <i>usage and disposition</i> of the objects of
poetry, that we are to seek for proofs and evidences
of plagiarism. And yet it may not be
every instance of similarity, that will satisfy
here. For the question recurs, “whether of
the several <i>forms</i>, of which his materials
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
are susceptible, there be nothing in the nature
of things, which determines the artist
to prefer a <i>particular</i> one to all others.”
For it is possible, that <i>general principles</i> may
as well account for a <i>conformity in the manner</i>,
as we have seen them do for an <i>identity of
matter</i>, in works of imitation. And to this
question nothing can be replied, till we have
taken an accurate survey of this <i>second division</i>
of our subject. Luckily, the allusion to architecture,
just touched upon, points to the
very method, in which it may be most distinctly
pursued. For here too, the <small>MANNER</small>
<i>of imitation</i>, if considered in its full extent,
takes in 1. <i>The general plan or disposition
of a poem.</i> 2. <i>The choice and application of
particular subjects: and</i> 3. <i>The expression.</i></p>

<p>I. <i>All poetry</i>, as lord Bacon admirably
observes, “<i>nihil aliud est quam</i> <small>HISTORIAE
IMITATIO AD PLACITUM</small>.” By which is not
meant, that the poet is at liberty to conduct
his <i>imitation</i> absolutely in any manner he
pleases, but with such deviations from the
rule of history, as the <i>end</i> of poetry prescribes.
This end is, universally, <small>PLEASURE</small>; as <i>that</i>
of simple history is, <small>INFORMATION</small>. And from
a respect to this <i>end</i>, together with some proper
allowance for the diversity of the <i>subject-matter</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and the <i>mode of imitation</i> (I mean
whether it be in the way of <i>recital</i>, or of
action) are the essential differences of poetry
from mere history, and the <i>form or disposition</i>
of its several <i>species</i>, derived. What these
<i>differences</i> are, and what the <i>general plan</i>
in the composition of <i>each species</i>, will appear
from considering the <i>defects</i> of simple history
in reference to the <i>main end</i>, which
poetry designs.</p>

<p>Some of these are observed by the great
person before-mentioned, which I shall want
no excuse for giving in his own words.</p>

<p>“1. Cum res gestae et eventus, qui verae
historiae subjiciuntur, non sint ejus amplitudinis,
in qu&acirc; anima humana sibi satisfaciat,
praesto est <i>po&euml;sis</i>, quae facta magis
heroica confingat. 2. Cum historia vera
successus rerum minime pro meritis virtutum
&amp; scelerum, narret; corrigit eam <i>po&euml;sis</i>, &amp;
exitus &amp; fortunas, secundum merita, &amp; ex
lege Nemeseos, exhibet. 3. Cum historia
vera, obvi&acirc; rerum satietate &amp; similitudine,
animae humanae fastidio sit; reficit eam
po&euml;sis, inexpectata, &amp; varia &amp; vicissitudinum
plena canens.&mdash;Quare &amp; merito etiam divinitatis
cujuspiam particeps videri possit; quia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
animum erigit &amp; in sublime rapit; <i>rerum
simulachra ad animi desideria accommodando,
non animum rebus (quod ratio facit,
&amp; historia) submittendo</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.”</p>

<p>These <i>advantages</i> chiefly respect the <i>narrative</i>
poetry, and above all, the <i>Epos</i>. There
are others, still more <i>general</i>, and more directly
to the purpose of this inquiry. For 4.
The <i>historian</i> is bound to record <i>a series of
independent events and actions</i>; and so, at
once, falls into two <i>defects</i>, which make him
incapable of affording perfect <i>pleasure</i> to the
mind. For 1. The flow of passion, produced
in us by contemplating <i>any signal event</i>, is
greatly checked and disturbed amidst a <i>variety
and succession of actions</i>. And 2. being
obliged to pass with celerity over <i>each</i> transaction
(for otherwise history would be too tedious
for the purpose of <i>information</i>) he has
not time to draw out <i>single circumstances</i> in
full light and impress them with all their force
on the imagination. <i>Poetry</i> remedies these
two defects. By confining the attention to
<i>one</i> object only, it gives the fancy and affections
fair play: and by bringing forth to view
and even magnifying all the <i>circumstances</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
that <i>one</i>, it gives to every subject its proper
dignity and importance. 5. Lastly, to satisfy
the human mind, there must not only be an
<i>unity and integrity</i>, but a strict <i>connexion
and continuity</i> of the fable or action represented.
Otherwise the mind languishes, and
the transition of the passions, which gives the
chief pleasure, is broken and interrupted. The
<i>historian</i> fails, also, in this. By proceeding
in the gradual and orderly succession of <i>time</i>,
the several incidents, which compose the story,
are not laid close enough together to content
the natural avidity of our expectations. Whilst
<i>poetry</i>, neglecting this regularity of succession,
and setting out in the midst of the story, gratifies
our instinctive impatience, and carries
the <i>affections</i> along, with the utmost rapidity,
towards the <i>event</i>.</p>

<p>These <i>advantages</i> are common both to <i>narrative</i>
and <i>dramatic</i> poetry. But the <i>drama</i>,
as professing to copy <i>real life</i>, contents itself
with these. The rest belong entirely to the
province of <i>narration</i>.</p>

<p>Now the <i>general forms</i> of poetical method,
as distinct from <i>that</i> of history, are the pure
result of our conclusions concerning the expediency
and fitness of these <i>means</i>, as conducive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
to the proper <i>end</i> of poetry. Which, without
more words, will inform us, how it came to
pass, that the <i>true plan or disposition of
poetical</i> works, was so early hit upon in <i>practice</i>,
and established by exact <i>theories</i>; and
may therefore satisfy us of the <i>necessary</i>
resemblance and uniformity of all productions
of this kind, whether their authors had, or had
not, been guided by the pole-star of <i>example</i>.</p>

<p>So much for the <i>general forms</i> of the two
greater <i>kinds</i> of poetry. If a proper allowance
be made for a diversity of <i>subject-matter</i>, in
either <i>mode</i> of composition, it will be easy, as
I said, to account for the <i>particular forms</i> of
the several subordinate species. And I the
rather choose to do it in this way, and not
from the peculiar <i>end</i> of each, which indeed
were more philosophical, because the business
is to make appear, how nature leads to the
same general plan of composition in <i>practice</i>,
not to establish the laws of each in the exact
way of <i>theory</i>. Now in considering the matter
<i>historically</i>, the diversity of <i>subject-matter</i>
was doubtless <i>that</i> which first determined the
writer to a different <i>form</i> of composition, tho’
afterwards, a consideration of the <i>end</i>, accomplished
by <i>each</i>, be requisite to deduce, with
more precision of method, its distinct laws.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
The <i>latter</i> is that from whence the <i>speculative
critic</i> rightly estimates the character of every
species; but the inventor had his direction
principally from the <i>former</i>.</p>

<p>Let me exemplify the observation in an
instance under either <i>mode</i> of imitation, and
leave the rest to the reader.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Georgic</span> is a species of <i>narration</i>.
But, as <i>things</i>, not <i>persons</i>, are its subject
(from which last alone the <i>unity of design</i> and
<i>continuity of action</i> arise) this circumstance
absolves it from the necessity of observing any
other laws, than those of clear and perspicuous
disposition, and of enlivening a matter, naturally
uninteresting, by <i>exquisite expression</i> and
<i>pleasing digressions</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Pastoral</span> poem may be considered
as a lower species of the <i>Drama</i>. But, its
subject being the <i>humble concerns</i> of Shepherds,
there seems no room for a tragic <i>Plot</i>;
and their characters are too simple to afford
materials for comic <i>drawing</i>. Their <i>scene</i> is
indeed inchanting to the imagination. And,
together with this, their little distresses may
sooth us in a short song; or their fancies and
humours may entertain us in a short Dialogue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
And that this is the proper province of the
Pastoral Muse, we may see by the ill success
of those who have laboured to extend it.
Tasso’s project was admired for a time. But
we, now, understand that pastoral affairs will
not admit a tragic pathos. And the continuance
of the pastoral vein, through five long acts, is
found insipid, or even distasteful. This poem
then has returned to that form which its
inventors gave it, and which the <i>subject</i> so
naturally prescribes to it.</p>

<p><small>II</small>. But, though the <i>common end</i> of poetry,
which is to <i>please by imitation</i>, together with
the subjects of its several species, may determine
the <i>general plan</i>, yet is there nothing,
it may be said, in the nature of things to fix
<i>the order and connexion of single parts</i>. And
here, it will be owned, is great room for <i>invention</i>
to shew itself. The materials of poetry
may be put together in so many different
manners, consistently with the <i>form</i> which
governs each species, that nothing but the
power of <i>imitation</i> can be reasonably thought
to produce <i>a close and perpetual similarity</i>
in the composition of two works. I have said
<i>a close and perpetual similarity</i>; for it is
not every degree of resemblance, that will do
here.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>The <i>general plan itself</i> of any poem will
occasion some unavoidable conformities in the
disposition of its component parts. The <i>identity</i>
or <i>similarity</i> of the subject may create
others. Or, if no other assimilating cause
intervene, the very uniformity of common
nature, will, of necessity, introduce some. To
explain myself as to the last of these <i>causes</i>.</p>

<p>The principal constituent members of any
work, next to the essential parts of the <i>fable</i>,
are <small>EPISODES</small>, <small>DESCRIPTIONS</small>, <small>SIMILES</small>. By
<i>descriptions</i> I understand as well the delineation
of <i>characters</i> in their <i>speeches and imputed
sentiments</i>, as of <i>places or things</i> in the
draught of their attending circumstances. Now
not only the materials of these are common to
all poets, but the same identical manner of
assemblage in application of <i>each</i> in any poem
will, in numberless cases, appear necessary.</p>

<p>1. The <i>episode</i> belongs, principally, to the
epic muse; and the design of it is to diversify
and ennoble the narration by <i>digressive</i>, yet
not <i>unrelated</i>, ornaments; the <i>former</i> circumstance
relieving the <i>simplicity</i> of the epic
fable, while the <i>other</i> prevents its <i>unity</i> from
being violated. Now these episodical narrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
must either proceed from the poet himself,
or be imputed to some other who is engaged
in the course of the fable; and in either case,
must help, indirectly at least, to forward it.</p>

<p>If of the <i>latter</i> kind, a probable pretext
must be contrived for their introduction; which
can be no other than that of satisfying the
<i>curiosity</i>, or of serving to the necessary <i>information</i>
of some other. And in either of these
ways a striking conformity in the mode of conducting
the work is unavoidable.</p>

<p>If the <i>episode</i> be referred to the <i>former</i> class,
its <i>manner</i> of introduction will admit a greater
latitude. For it will vary with the subject, or
occasions of relating it. Yet we shall mistake,
if we believe these subjects, and consequently
the occasions, connected with them, very numerous.
1. They must be of uncommon
dignity and splendor; otherwise nothing can
excuse the going out of the way to insert them.
2. They must have some apparent connection
with the fable. 3. They must further accord
to the idea and state of the times, from which
the <i>fable</i> is taken. Put these things together,
and see if they will not, with probability, account
for some coincidence <i>in the choice and</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
<i>applications</i> of the <i>direct</i> episode. And admitting
this, the similarity of even <i>its</i> constituent
parts is, also, necessary.</p>

<p>The genius of Virgil never suffers more in
the opinion of his critics, than when his <i>book
of games</i> comes into consideration and is confronted
with Homer’s. It is not unpleasant
to observe the difficulties an advocate for his
fame is put to in this nice point, to secure his
honour from the imputation of <i>plagiarism</i>.
The descriptions are accurately examined;
and the improvement of a single circumstance,
the addition of an epithet, even the novelty of
a metaphor, or varied turn in the expression,
is diligently remarked and urged, with triumph,
in favour of his invention. Yet all this goes
but a little way towards stilling the clamour.
The entire design is manifestly taken; nay,
particular incidents and circumstantials are,
for the most part, the same, without variation.
What shall we say, then, to this charge?
Shall we, in defiance of truth and fact, endeavour
to confute it? Or, if allowed, is there
any method of supporting the reputation of the
poet? I think there is, if prejudice will but
suspend its determinations a few minutes, and
afford his advocate a fair hearing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>The epic plan, more especially that of the
Aeneis, naturally comprehends whatever is
most august in <i>civil</i> and <i>religious</i> affairs. The
solemnities of funeral rites, and the festivities
of public games (which religion had made an
essential part of them) were, of necessity, to
be included in a representation of the <i>latter</i>.
But what <i>games</i>? Surely those, which ancient
heroism vaunted to excell in; those,
which the usage of the times had consecrated;
and which, from the opinion of reverence and
dignity entertained of them, were become
most fit for the pomp of epic description.
Further, what <i>circumstances</i> could be noted
in these sports? Certainly those, which befell
most usually, and were the aptest to alarm the
spectator, and make him take an interest in
them. These, it will be said, are numerous.
They are so; yet such as are most to the poet’s
purpose, are, with little or no variation, the
same. It happened luckily for him, that two
of his <i>games</i>, on which accordingly he hath
exerted all the force of his genius, were entirely
new. This advantage, the circumstances of
the times afforded him. The <i>Naumachia</i> was
purely his own. Yet so liable are even the
best and most candid judges to be haunted by
this spectre of <i>imitation</i>, that <i>one</i>, whom every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
friend to every human excellence honours,
cannot help, on comparing it with the <i>chariot-race</i>
of Homer, exclaiming in these words:
“What is the encounter of Cloanthus and Gyas
in the strait between the rocks, but the same
with that of Menelaus and Antilochus in the
hollow way? Had the galley of Serjestus
been broken, if the chariot of Eumelus had
not been demolished? Or, Mnestheus been
cast from the helm, had not the other been
thrown from his seat?” The plain truth is,
it was not possible, in describing an ancient
<i>sea-fight</i>, for one, who had even never seen
Homer, to overlook such usual and striking
particulars, as the <i>justling of ships, the
breaking of galleys, and loss of pilots</i>.</p>

<p>It may appear from this instance, with what
reason a similarity of circumstance, in the other
games, hath been objected. The <i>subject-matter</i>
admitted not any material variation: I
mean in the hands of so judicious a copier of
Nature as Virgil. For,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Homer and Nature were, he found, the same.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>So that we are not to wonder he kept close to
his author, though at the expence of this
false fame of <i>Originality</i>. Nay it appears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
directly from a remarkable instance that in
the case before us, He unquestionably judged
right.</p>

<p>A defect of <i>natural ability</i> is not that, which
the critics have been most forward to charge
upon <i>Statius</i>. A person of true taste, who,
in a fanciful way, hath contrived to give us the
just character of the Latin poets, in assigning
to this poet the topmost station on Parnassus,
sufficiently acknowledges the vigour and activity
of his genius. Yet, in composing his
<i>Thebaid</i> (an old story taken from the heroic
ages, which obliged him to the celebration of
<i>funeral obsequies</i> with the attending solemnities
of <i>public games</i>) to avoid the dishonour of
following too closely on the heels of Homer
and Virgil, who had not only taken the same
<i>route</i>, but pursued it in the most direct and
natural course, he resolved, at all adventures,
to keep at due distance from them, and to
make his way, as well as he could, more
<i>obliquely</i> to the same end. To accomplish
this project, he was forced, though in the
description of the same individual <i>games</i>, to
look out for different <i>circumstances and events</i>
in them; that so the identity of his <i>subject</i>,
which he could not avoid, might, in some
degree, be atoned for by the diversity of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
<i>manner</i> in treating it. It must be owned,
that great ingenuity as well as industry hath
been used, in executing this design. Had it
been practicable, the character, just given of
this poet, makes it credible, he must have
succeeded in it. Yet, so impossible it is,
without deserting nature herself, to dissent
from her faithful copiers, that the main objection
to the sixth book of the <i>Thebaid</i> hath
arisen from this fruitless endeavour of being
<i>original</i>, where common sense and the reason
of the thing would not permit it. “In the
particular descriptions of each of these games
(says the great writer before quoted, and
from whose sentence in matters of taste,
there lies no appeal) <i>Statius</i> hath not borrowed
from either of his predecessors, <i>and
his poem is so much the worse for it</i>.”</p>

<p>2. The case of <small>DESCRIPTION</small> is still clearer,
and, after what has been so largely discoursed on
the <i>subjects</i> of it, will require but few words.
For it must have appeared, in considering
them, that not only the <i>objects</i> themselves are
necessarily obtruded on the poet, but that the
<i>occasions</i> of introducing them are also restrained
by many limitations. If we reflect a
little, we shall find, that they grow out of the
<i>action</i> represented, which, in the greater poetry,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
implies a great <i>similarity</i>, even when most
<i>different</i>. What, for instance, is the purpose
of <i>the epic poet</i>, but to shew his hero under
the most awful and interesting circumstances of
human life? To this end some general design
is formed. He must <i>war</i> with Achilles, or
<i>voyage</i> with Ulysses. And, to work up his
<i>fable</i> to that <i>magnificence</i>, ΜΕΓΑΛΟΠΡΕΠΕΙΑΝ,
which Aristotle rightly observes to be
the characteristic of this poem, <i>heaven</i> and
<i>hell</i> must also be interested in the success of
his enterprise. And what is this, in <i>effect</i>,
but to own, that the pomp of <i>epic description</i>,
in its draught of <i>battles</i>, with its several <i>accidents</i>;
of <i>storms</i>, <i>shipwrecks</i>, &amp;c. <i>of the intervention
of gods</i>, or <i>machination of devils</i>,
is, in great measure, determined, not only as
to the <i>choice</i>, but <i>application</i> of it, to the
poet’s hands? And the like conclusion extends
to still minuter particularities.</p>

<p>What concerns the delineation of <i>characters</i>
may seem to carry with it more difficulty. Yet,
though these are infinitely diversified by distinct
peculiar lineaments, poetry cannot help
falling into the same <i>general</i> representation.
For it is conversant about the <i>greater characters</i>;
such as demand the imputation of
like <i>manners</i>, and who are actuated by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
same governing <i>passions</i>. To set off these,
<i>the same combination of circumstances</i> must
frequently be imagined; at least so <i>similar</i>, as
to bring on the same series of representation.
The <i>piety</i> of <i>one</i> hero, and the <i>love of his
country</i>, which characterizes <i>another</i>, can
only be shewn by the influence of the <i>ruling
principle</i> in each, constraining them to neglect
inferior considerations, and to give up all
subordinate affections to it. The more prevalent
the <i>affection</i>, the greater the <i>sacrifice</i>,
and the more strongly is the <i>character</i> marked.
Hence, without doubt, the <i>Calypso</i> of Homer.
And need we look farther than the instructions
of <i>common nature</i> for a similar contrivance in
a <i>later</i> poet? Not to be tedious on a matter,
which admits no dispute, the dramatic writings
of all times may convince us of <i>two things</i>, 1.
“<i>that the actuating passions of men are universally
and invariably the same</i>;” and 2.
“<i>that they express themselves constantly in
similar effects</i>.” Or, one single small volume,
<i>the characters of Theophrastus</i>, will
sufficiently do it. And what more is required
to justify this consequence, “that <i>the descriptions
of characters</i>, even in the most original
<i>designers</i>, will resemble each other;”
and “that the very <i>contexture</i> of a work, designed
to evidence them in <i>action</i>, will,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
under the management of different writers,
be, frequently, much the same?” A <i>conclusion</i>,
which indeed is neither mine nor any
novel one, but was long ago insisted on by a
discerning ancient, and applied to the comic
drama, in these words,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Si personis isdem uti aliis non licet,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui magis licet currentis servos scribere,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Parasitum edacem, gloriosum militem,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Puerum supponi, falli per servum senem</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Amare, odisse, suspicari</span>?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. In truth, so far as <i>direct and immediate
description</i> is concerned, the matter is so plain,
that it will hardly be called into question.
The difficulty is to account for the similarity
of <i>metaphor and</i> <small>COMPARISON</small> (that is, of <i>imagery</i>,
which comes in obliquely, and for the
purpose of illustrating some other, and, frequently,
very remote and distinct subject)
observable in all writers. Here it may not
seem quite so easy to make out an original
claim; for, though descriptions of the <i>same
object</i>, when it occurs, must needs be similar,
yet it remains to shew how the same object
comes, in this case, to occur at all. Before
an answer can be given to this question, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
must be observed 1. that there is in the mind
of man, not only a strong natural love of <i>imitation</i>,
but of <i>comparison</i>. We are not only
fond of <i>copying</i> single objects, as they present
themselves, but we delight to set two objects
together, and contemplate their mutual aspects
and appearances. The <i>pleasure</i> we find in
this exercise of the imagination is the main
source of that perpetual usage of <i>indirect and
allusive imagery</i> in the writings of the poets;
for I need not here consider the <i>necessity</i> of
the thing, and the unavoidable introduction of
sensible images into all language. 2. This
work of <i>comparison</i> is not gone about by the
mind <i>causelessly and capriciously</i>. There are
certain obvious and striking resemblances in
nature, which the poet is carried necessarily
to observe, and which offer themselves to him
on the slightest exercise and exertion of his
<i>comparing</i> powers. It may be difficult to
explain the causes of this established relationship
in all cases; or to shew distinctly, what
these secret ties and connexions are, which
link the objects of sense together, and draw the
imagination thus insensibly from one subject
to another. The most obvious and natural is
that of <i>actual similitude</i>, whether in <i>shape,
attitude, colour</i>, or <i>aspect</i>. As when <i>heroes</i>
are compared to <i>gods</i>,&mdash;<i>a hero in act to strike
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
at his foe</i>, to <i>a faulcon stooping at a dove</i>,&mdash;<i>blood
running down the skin</i>, to <i>the staining
of ivory</i>,&mdash;<i>corn waving with the wind</i>, to
<i>water in motion</i>. Sometimes the associating
cause lies in the <i>effect</i>. As when the <i>return
of a good prince to his country</i> is compared <i>to
the sun</i>&mdash;a <i>fresh gale to mariners</i>, to <i>the
timely coming of a general to his troops</i>, &amp;c.
more commonly, in some <i>property</i>, <i>attribute</i>,
or <i>circumstance</i>. Thus an <i>intrepid</i> hero suggests
the idea of a <i>rock</i>, on account of <i>its firmness
and stability</i>;&mdash;of <i>a lion</i>, for his <i>fierceness</i>,&mdash;<i>of
a deer encompassed</i> with wolves, for
his <i>situation when surrounded with enemies</i>.
In short, for I pretend not to make a complete
enumeration of the <i>grounds</i> of connexion,
whatever the mind observes in any object, that
bears an analogy to something in any other,
becomes the <i>occasion</i> of comparison betwixt
them; and the fancy, which is ever, in a great
genius, quick at espying these <i>traits</i> of resemblance,
and delights to survey them, lets
dip no opportunity of setting them over
against each other, and producing them to
observation.</p>

<p>But whatever be the <i>causes</i>, which associate
the ideas of the poet, and how fantastic soever
or even casual, may sometimes appear to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the <i>ground</i> of such association, yet, in respect
of the greater works of genius, there will still
be found the most exact <i>uniformity</i> of allusion,
the same ideas and aspects of things constantly
admonishing the poet of the same <i>resemblances
and relations</i>. I say, in <i>the greater works
of genius</i>, which must be attended to; for
the folly of taking <i>resemblances</i> for <i>imitations</i>,
in this province of <i>allusion</i>, hath arisen
from hence; that the poet is believed to have
all art and nature before him, and to be at
liberty to fetch his <i>hints</i> of similitude and correspondence
from every distant and obscure
corner of the universe. That is, the genius
of the epic, dramatic, and universally, of the
greater, poetry hath not been comprehended,
nor their distinct laws and characters distinguished
from those of an inferior species.</p>

<p>The <i>mutual habitudes and relations</i> (at
least what the mind is capable of regarding as
<i>such</i>), subsisting between those innumerable
objects of thought and sense, which make up
the entire natural and intellectual world, are
indeed infinite; and if the poet be allowed to
associate and bring together all those ideas,
wherein the ingenuity of the mind can perceive
any remote sign or glimpse of <i>resemblance</i>, it
were truly wonderful, that, in any number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
images and allusions, there should be found a
close conformity of them with those of any
other writer. But this is far from being the
case. For 1. the more august poetry disclaims,
as unsuited to its state and dignity, that inquisitive
and anxious diligence, which pries into
nature’s retirements; and searches through all
her secret and hidden haunts, to detect a forbidden
commerce, and expose to light some
strange unexpected conjunction of ideas. This
quaint combination of remote, unallied imagery,
constitutes a species of entertainment,
which, for its <i>novelty</i>, may amuse and divert
the mind in other compositions; but is wholly
inconsistent with the reserve and solemnity of
the <i>graver</i> forms. There is too much curiosity
of art, too solicitous an affectation of
<i>pleasing</i>, in these ingenious exercises of the
fancy, to suit with the simple majesty of the
<i>epos</i> or <i>drama</i>; which disclaims to cast about
for forced and tortured allusions, and aims
only to expose, in the fairest light, such as
are most obvious and natural. And here, by
the way, it may be worth observing, in honour
of a great Poet of the last century, I mean Dr.
<span class="smcap">Donne</span>, that, though agreeably to the turn of
his genius, and taste of his age, he was fonder,
than ever poet was, of these <i>secret and hidden</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
<i>ways</i> in his lesser poetry; yet when he had
projected his great work “<i>On the progress of
the soul</i>” (of which we have only the beginning)
his good sense brought him out into
the freer <i>spaces</i> of nature and open day-light.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Largior hic compos &aelig;ther, et lumine vestit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purpureo: solemque suum, sua sidera norunt.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this, the author of <span class="smcap">Gondibert</span>, and another
writer of credit, a contemporary of <span class="smcap">Donne</span>,
Sir <span class="smcap">Fulk Grevil</span>, were not so happy. 2.
This work of <i>indirect imagery</i> is intended,
not so much to illustrate and enforce the original
thought, to which it is applied, as to
amuse and entertain the fancy, by holding up
to view, in these occasional digressive representations,
the pictures of pleasing scenes and
objects. But this <i>end</i> of allusion (which is
principal in the sublimer works of genius) restrains
the poet to the use of a few select
images, for the most part taken from obvious
common nature; these being always most
illustrious in themselves, and therefore most
apt to seize and captivate the imagination of
the reader. Thus is the poet confined, by the
very nature of his work, to a very moderate
compass of allusion, on both these accounts;
<i>first</i>, as he must employ the easiest and most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
apparent resemblances: and <i>secondly</i>, of <i>these</i>,
such as impress the most delightful images on
the fancy.</p>

<p>This being the case, it cannot but happen,
that the allusions of different poets, of the
higher class, though writing without any communication
with each other, will, of course,
be much the same on similar occasions. There
are fixed and real analogies between different
<i>material objects</i>; between these objects, and
the <i>inward workings</i> of the mind; and, again,
between these, and the <i>external signs</i> of them.
Such, on every occasion, do not so properly
offer themselves to the searching eye of the
poet, as force themselves upon him; so that,
if he submit to be guided by the most natural
views of things, he cannot avoid a very remarkable
correspondence of imagery with his predecessors.
And we find this conclusion verified
in fact; as appears not only from comparing
together the great ancient and modern
writers, who are known to have held an intimate
correspondence with each other, but
those, who cannot be suspected of this commerce.
Several critics, I observed, have taken
great pains to illustrate the sentiments of Homer
from similar instances in the sacred writers.
The same design might easily be carried on,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
in respect of <i>allusive imagery</i>; it being obvious
to common observation, that numberless
of the most beautiful <i>comparisons</i> in the Greek
poet are to be met with in the Hebrew prophets.
Nay, the remark may be extended to
the undisciplined writers and speakers of the
farthest <i>west</i> and <i>east</i>, whom nature instructs
to beautify and adorn their conceptions with the
same imagery. So little doth it argue an inferiority
of genius in Virgil, if it be true, as the
excellent translator of Homer says, “that he
has scarcely any <i>comparisons</i>, which are not
drawn from his master.”</p>

<p>The truth is, the <i>nature</i> of the two subjects,
which the Greek poet had taken upon himself
to adorn, was such, that it led him through
every circumstance and situation of human
life; which his quick attentive observation
readily found the means of shewing to advantage
under the cover of the most fit and proper
imagery. Succeeding writers, who had <i>not</i>
contemplated his pictures, yet, drawing from
one common original, have unknowingly hit
upon the very same. And those, who <i>had</i>,
with all their endeavours after <i>novelty</i>, and
the utmost efforts of genius to strike out original
lights, have never been able to succeed
in their attempts. Our <i>Milton</i>, who was most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
ambitious of this fame of <i>invention</i>, and whose
vast and universal genius could not have missed
of new <i>analogies</i>, had nature’s self been able
to furnish them, is a glaring instance to our
purpose. He was so averse from resting in
the old imagery of Homer, and the other epic
poets, that he appears to have taken infinite
pains in the investigation of new <i>allusions</i>,
which he picked up out of the rubbish of every
silly legend or romance, that had come to his
knowledge, or extracted from the dry and
rugged materials of the sciences, and even the
mechanic arts. Yet, in comparison of the
genuine treasures of nature, which he found
himself obliged to make use of, in common
with other writers, his own proper stock of
<i>images</i>, imported from the regions of <i>art</i>, is
very poor and scanty; and, as might be expected,
makes the least agreeable part of his
divine work.</p>

<p>What is here said of the epic holds, as I
hinted, of all the more serious kinds of poetry.
In works of a lighter cast, there is greater
liberty and a larger field of allusion permitted
to the poet. All the appearances in <i>art</i> and
<i>nature</i>, betwixt which there is any resemblance,
may be employed here to surprize and divert
the fancy. The further and more remote from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
vulgar apprehension these analogies lie, so
much the fitter for his purpose, which is not
so much to illustrate his ideas, as to place
them in new and uncommon lights, and entertain
the mind by that odd fantastic conjunction,
or opposition of ideas, which we
know by the name of <i>wit</i>. Nay, the <i>lowest</i>,
as well as the least obvious imagery will be,
oftentimes, the most proper; his view being
not to ennoble and raise his subject by the
means of <i>allusion</i>, but to sink and debase it
by every art, that hath a tendency to excite
the mirth and provoke the ridicule of the
reader. Here then we may expect a much
more original air, than in the higher designs
of invention. When all nature is before the
poet, and the genius of his work allows him
to seize her, as the shepherd did Proteus, in
every dirty form, into which she can possibly
twist herself, it were, indeed, a wonder, if he
should <i>chance</i> to coincide, in his imagery,
with any other, from whom he had not expressly
copied. They who are conversant in
works of <i>wit and humour</i>, more especially of
these later times, will know this to be the case,
in <i>fact</i>. There is not perhaps a single comparison
in the inimitable <span class="smcap">Telemaque</span>, which
had not, before, been employed by some or
other of the poets. Can any thing, like this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
be said of <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>, <span class="smcap">Butler</span>, <span class="smcap">Marvel</span>,
<span class="smcap">Swift</span>, &amp;c.?</p>

<p><small>III</small>. It only remains to consider the <small>EXPRESSION</small>.
And in this are to be found the surest
and least equivocal marks of <i>imitation</i>. We
may regard it in <i>two</i> lights; either 1. as it
respects the <i>general</i> turn or manner of writing,
which we call a <i>style</i>; or 2. the peculiarities
of <i>phrase and diction</i>.</p>

<p>1. A <i>style</i> in writing, if not formed in
express imitation of some certain <i>model</i>, is the
pure result of the disposition of the mind, and
takes its character from the predominant <i>quality</i>
of the writer. Thus a <i>short and compact</i>,
and a <i>diffused and flowing</i> expression are the
proper consequences of certain corresponding
characters of the human genius. One has a
vigorous comprehensive conception, and therefore
collects his sense into few words. Another,
whose imagination is more languid, contemplates
his objects leisurely, and so displays
their beauties in a greater compass of words,
and with more circumstance and parade of
language. A polite and elegant humour delights
in the grace of ease and perspicuity. A
severe and melancholic spirit inspires a forcible
but involved expression. There are many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
other nicer differences and peculiarities of
<i>manner</i>, which, though not reducible, perhaps,
to general heads, the critic of true taste
easily understands.</p>

<p>2. As men of different tempers and dispositions
assume a different cast of expression,
so may the same observation be applied, still
more <i>generally</i>, to different <i>countries and
times</i>. It may be difficult to explain the <i>efficient
causes</i> of this diversity, which I have no
concern with at present. The <i>fact</i> is, that
the eloquence of the <i>eastern</i> world has, at all
times, been of another strain from that of the
<i>western</i>. And, also, in the several provinces
of <i>each</i>, there has been some peculiar <i>note</i> of
variation. The <i>Asiatic</i>, of old, had its proper
stamp, which distinguished it from the <i>Attic</i>;
just as the <i>Italian</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Spanish</i> wits
have, each, their several characteristic manners
of expression.</p>

<p>A different state of <i>times</i> has produced the
like effect; which a late writer accounts for,
not unaptly, from what he calls a <i>progression
of life and manners</i>. That which cannot be
disputed is, that the <i>modes</i> of writing undergo
a perpetual change or variation in every country.
And it is further observable, that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
<i>changes</i> in one country, under similar circumstances,
have a signal correspondence to those,
which the incessant rotation of taste brings
about in every other.</p>

<p>Of near affinity to this last consideration is
<i>another</i> arising from the <i>corresponding genius</i>
of two people, however remote from each other
in time and place. And, as it happens, the
application may be made directly to ourselves
in a very important instance. “Languages,
says one, always take their character from
the genius of a people. So that two the
most distant states, thinking and acting with
the same generous love of mankind, must
needs have very near the same combinations
of ideas.&mdash;And it is our boast that in this
conformity we approach the nearest to ancient
Greece and Italy.” I quote these words
from a tract<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, which the author perhaps may
consider with the same neglect, as Cicero did
his earlier compositions on <i>Rhetoric</i>; but
which the curious will regard with reverence,
as a fine essay of his genius, and a prelude to
the great things he was afterwards seen capable
of producing. But to come to the use we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
make of this fine observation. The corresponding
state of the English and Roman
people has produced very near the same <i>combinations
of ideas</i>. May we not carry the
conclusion still further on the same principle,
that it produced very near the same <i>combinations
of words</i>? The fact is, as the same
writer observes, That “we have a language
that is brief, comprehensive, nervous, and
majestic.” The very character which an old
Roman would give us of his own language.
And when the same general character of language
prevails, is it any thing strange that the
different modifications of it, or <i>peculiar styles</i>,
arising from the various turns and dispositions
of writers (which, too, in such circumstances
will be corresponding) should therefore be very
similar in the productions of the two states?
Or, in other words, can we wonder that some
of our best writers bear a nearer resemblance,
I mean independently of direct imitation, to
the Latin classics, than those of any other
people in modern times?</p>

<p>But let it suffice to leave these remarks
without further comment or explanation.</p>

<p>The use the discerning reader will make
of them is, that if different writers agree in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the same <i>general disposition</i>, or in the same
<i>national character</i>; live together in the <i>same
period of time</i>; or in corresponding periods
of the <i>progression of manners</i>, or are under
the influence of a corresponding genius of <i>policy
and government</i>; in every of these cases,
some <i>considerable similarity</i> of expression
may be occasioned by the agency of <i>general
principles</i>, without any suspicion of studied or
designed <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p><small>II.</small> An <i>identity of phrase and diction</i>, is a
much surer note of <i>plagiarism</i>. For considering
the vast variety of <i>words</i>, which any
language, and especially the more copious ones
furnish, and the infinite possible combinations
of them into all the forms of <i>phraseology</i>, it
would be very strange, if two persons should
hit on the same identical <i>terms</i>, and much
more should they agree in the same precise
arrangement of them in whole sentences.</p>

<p>There is no defending <i>coincidences</i> of this
kind; and whatever writers themselves may
pretend, or their friends for them, no one can
doubt a moment of such <i>identity</i> being a clear
and decisive proof of <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>Yet this must be understood with some
limitations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>For 1. There are in every language some
current and authorized forms of speech, which
can hardly be avoided by a writer without
affectation. They are such as express the
most obvious sentiments, and which the ordinary
occasions of life are perpetually obtruding
on us. Now these, as by common agreement,
we chuse to deliver to one another in the same
<i>form</i> of words. Convenience dictates this to
one set of writers, and politeness renders it
sacred in another. Thus it will be true of
certain <i>phrases</i> (as, universally, of the <i>words</i>,
in any language), that they are left in common
to all writers, and can be claimed as matter of
<i>property</i>, by none. Not that such phraseology
will be frequent in nobler compositions,
as the familiarity of its usage takes from their
natural reserve and dignity. Yet on certain
<i>occasions</i>, which justify this negligence, or in
certain <i>authors</i>, who are not over-sollicitous
about these indecorums, we may expect to
meet with it. Hamlet says of his father,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>He was a man, take him for all in all</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not look upon his like again.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>which may be suspected of being stolen from
Sophocles, who has the following passage in
the <span class="smcap">Trachiniae</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Πάντων ἄριστον ἄνδρα τῶν ἐπὶ χθονὶ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Κτείνασ’, ΟΠΟΙΟΝ ΑΛΛΟΝ ΟΥΚ ΟΨΕΙ ΠΟΤΕ.<br /></span>
<span class="author">v. 824.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sentiment being one of the commonest,
that offers itself to the mind, the sole ground
of suspicion must lie in the <i>expression</i>, “<i>I
shall not look upon his like again</i>,” to which
the Greek so exactly answers. But these were
the ordinary expressions of such sentiment, in
the two languages; and neither the characters
of the great poets, nor the situation of the
speakers, would suffer the <i>affectation</i> of departing
from common usage.</p>

<p>What is here said of the <i>situation of the
speakers</i> reminds me of another <i>class</i> of expressions,
which will often be <i>similar</i> in all
poets. <i>Nature</i>, under the <i>same</i> conjunctures,
gives birth to the <i>same</i> conceptions; and if they
be of such a kind, as to exclude all thought of
artifice, and the tricks of eloquence (as on
occasions of deep anxiety and distress) they
run, of themselves, into the <i>same</i> form of
expression. The wretched Priam, in his lamentation
of Hector, lets drop the following
words:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">οὗ μ’ ἄχος ὀξὺ κατοίσεται ἄ&iuml;δος εἴσω:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>“This line, says his translator, is particularly
tender, and almost, word for word, the
same with that of the Patriarch <i>Jacob</i>; who,
upon a like occasion, breaks out in the same
complaint, and tells his children, that, if
they deprive him of his son <i>Benjamin, they
will bring down his grey hairs with sorrow
to the grave</i>.”</p>

<p>We may, further, except, under this head,
certain privileged forms of speech, which the
peculiar idioms of <i>different</i> languages make
necessary in them, and which poetry consecrates
in <i>all</i>. But this is easily observed, and
its effect is not very considerable.</p>

<p>2. In pleading this <i>identity of expression</i>,
regard must be had to the <i>language</i>, from
which the <i>theft</i> is supposed to be made. If
from the <i>same</i> language (setting aside the exceptions,
just mentioned) <i>the same arrangement
of the same words</i> is admitted as a certain
argument of <i>plagiarism</i>: nay, less than this
will do in some instances, as where the <i>imitated
expression</i> is pretty <i>singular</i>, or so
remarkable, on any account, as to be <i>well
known</i>, &amp;c. But if from <i>another</i> language,
the matter is not so easy. It can rarely happen,
indeed, but by design, that there should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
be the <i>same order or composition</i> of words, in
two languages. But that which passes even
for <i>literal translation</i>, is but <i>a similar composition
of corresponding words</i>. And what
does this imply, but that the writers conceived
of their <i>object</i> in the same <i>manner</i>, and had
occasion to set it in the same light? An occasion,
which is perpetually recurring to all
authors. As may be gathered from that frequent
and strong resemblance in the <i>expression</i>
of moral sentiments, observable in the writers
of every age and country. Can there be a
commoner reflexion, or which more constantly
occurs to the mind under the same appearance,
than <i>that</i> of our great poet, who, speaking of
the state after death, calls it</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>That undiscovered country, from whose bourn</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No traveller returns</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shall we call this a translation of the Latin
poet;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nunc it per</i> iter tenebricosum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illuc, unde negant redire quenquam.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Catul.</span> III. v. 11.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or, doth it amount to any more than this,
that the terms employed by the two writers in
expressing the same obvious thought are <i>correspondent</i>?
But <i>correspondency</i> and <i>identity</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
are different things. The <i>latter</i> is only, where
the words are <i>numerically</i> the same, which
can only happen in one and the same language:
the other is effected by <i>different sets of words</i>,
which are numerous in every language, and
are therefore no convincing proof (abstractedly
from other circumstances) of <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>From these general reflexions on <i>language</i>,
without refining too far, or prying too curiously
into the mysteries of it, the same conclusion
meets us, as before. The <i>expression</i>
of two writers may be <i>similar</i>, and sometimes
even <i>identical</i>, and yet be <i>original</i> in both.
Which shews the necessity there was to lead
the reader through this long investigation of
the general sources of <i>similitude</i> in works of
<small>INVENTION</small>, in order to put him into a condition
of judging truly and equitably of those of
<small>IMITATION</small>. For if <i>similarity</i>, even in this
province of <i>words</i>, which the reason of the
thing shews to be most free from the constraint
of general rules, be no argument of <i>theft</i> in
all cases; much less can it be pretended of the
other <i>subjects</i> of this inquiry, which from the
necessary uniformity of <i>nature</i> in all her appearances,
and of <i>common sense</i> in its operations
upon them, must give frequent and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
unavoidable occasion to such <i>similarity</i>. But
then this is all I would insinuate.</p>

<p>For, after the proper allowances, which
candid criticism requires to be made on this
head, it will still be true (and nothing in this
Essay attempts to contradict it) “that coincidences
of a certain <i>kind</i>, and in a certain
<i>degree</i>, cannot fail to convict a writer of
<i>imitation</i>.” What these <i>are</i>, the impatient
reader, I suppose, is ready to enquire. And,
not entirely to disappoint him, I have thrown
together, at the close of this volume, some remarks
which, perhaps, will be of use in solving
that difficult question<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>. In the mean time, it
seemed of importance to free the mind from
the perversion of that early prejudice, which is
so prompt to mistake <i>resemblance</i> universally
for <i>imitation</i>. And what other method of effecting
this, than by taking a view of the extent
and influence of the genuine powers of <i>nature</i>,
which, when rightly apprehended, make it an
easier task to detect, in particular instances,
the intervention of <i>design</i>?</p>

<p>Allowing then (what this previous inquiry
not only no way contradicts but even assists us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
in perceiving more clearly) that certain <i>resemblances</i>
may be urged as undoubted proofs
of <i>imitation</i>, it remains only to the integrity
of this discourse, to satisfy that other question,
“<i>how far the credit of the imitator is concerned
in the discovery</i>;” or, in other words,
(since the praise of <i>invention</i> is of the highest
value to the poet) “how far the concession of
his having borrowed from others, may be
justly thought to detract from him in that
respect.” An <i>inquiry</i>, which, though for its
consequences to the fame of all great writers,
since the time of Homer, of much importance,
may yet be dispatched in few words.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<h3>SECTION II.</h3>

<p>In entering on this apology for <i>professed
imitators</i>, I shall not be suspected of undervaluing
the proper merits of <i>invention</i>, which
unquestionably holds the first place in the
<i>virtutes</i> of a poet, and is that power, which,
of all others, enables him to give the highest
entertainment to the reader. Much less will
it be thought, that I am here pleading the
cause of those base and abject spirits, who have
not the courage or ability to attempt any thing
of themselves, and can barely make a shift, as
a great poet of our own expresses it, <i>to creep
servilely after the sense of</i> some other. These
I readily resign to the shame and censure,
which have so justly followed them in all ages;
as subscribing to the truth of that remark,
“<i>Imitatio per se ipsa non sufficit</i>, vel <i>quia
pigri est ingenii, contentum esse iis, quae
sunt ab aliis inventa</i>.” My concern is only
with those, whose talent of original genius is
not disputed, but the <i>degree</i> of strength and
vigour, with which it prevails in them, somewhat
lowered in the general estimation, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
this imputed crime of <small>PLAGIARISM</small>. And, with
respect to such as these, something, I conceive,
may be said, not undeserving the notice
of the candid reader.</p>

<p>1. The most universal cause, inducing <i>imitation</i>
in great writers, is, the force of early
<i>discipline and education</i>. Were it true, that
poets took their <i>descriptions and images</i> immediately
from common nature, one might
expect, indeed, a general <i>similitude</i> in their
works, but such, as could seldom or never, in
all its circumstances, amount to a strict and
rigorous correspondency. The <i>properties</i> of
things are so numerous, and the <i>lights</i> in
which they shew themselves to a mind uninfluenced
by former prejudices, so different,
that some grace of novelty, some tincture of
original beauty, would constantly infuse itself
into all their delineations. But the case is far
otherwise. Strong as the bent of the imagination
may be to contemplate living forms, and
to gaze with delight on this grand theatre of
<i>nature</i>, its attention is soon taken off, and
arrested, on all sides, by those infinite mirrors,
and reflexions of things, which it every where
meets with in the world of <i>imitation</i>. We are
habituated to a survey of this <i>secondary and
derivative nature</i>; as presented in the admired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
works of <i>art</i>, through the entire course of our
education. The writings of the best poets are
put into our hands, to instruct us in the knowledge
of <i>men and things</i>, as soon as we are
capable of apprehending them. Nay, we are
taught to lisp their very <i>words</i>, in our tenderest
infancy. Some quick and transient
glances we cannot chuse but cast, at times,
on the ph&aelig;nomena of living beauty; but its
forms are rarely contemplated by us with diligence,
but in these <i>mirrors</i>, which are the
constant furniture of our schools and closets.
And no wonder, were we even left to ourselves,
that such should be our <i>proper</i> choice and
determination. For, by the prodigious and
almost magical operations of <i>fancy</i> on original
objects, they even shew fairer, and are made
to look more attractive, in these artificial representations,
than in their own rude and
native aspects. Thus, by the united powers
of <i>discipline</i> and <i>inclination</i>, we are almost
necessitated to <i>see</i> nature in the same <i>light</i>,
and to know her only in the <i>dress</i>, in which
her happier suitors and favourites first gave
her to observation.</p>

<p>The effect of this early bias of the mind,
which insensibly grows into the inveteracy of
habit, needs not be insisted on. When the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
poet, thus tutored in the works of <i>imitation</i>,
comes to address himself to <i>invention</i>, these
familiar images, which he hath so often and
so fondly admired, immediately step in and
intercept his observation of their great <i>original</i>.
Or, if he has power to hold them off, and
turn his eye directly on the <i>primary object</i>,
he still inclines to view it only on that side and
in those <i>lights</i>, in which he has been accustomed
to study it. Nor let it be said, that
this is the <i>infirmity</i>, only, of weak minds. It
belongs to our very natures, and the utmost
vigour of genius is no security against it. <i>Custom</i>,
in this as in every thing else, moulds, at
pleasure, the soft and ductile matter of a <i>minute</i>
spirit, and by degrees can even bend the
elastic metal of the <i>greatest</i>.</p>

<p>And if the force of habit can thus determine
a writer knowingly, to <i>imitation</i>, it cannot be
thought strange, that it should frequently carry
him into <i>resemblance</i>, when himself perhaps
is not aware of it. Great readers, who have
their memories fraught with the stores of ancient
and modern poetry, unavoidably employ
the <i>sentiments</i>, and sometimes the very <i>words</i>,
of other writers, without any distinct remembrance
of them, or so much as the suspicion
of having seen them. At the least, their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
general cast of thinking or turn of expression
will be much affected by them. For the most
original writer as certainly takes a <i>tincture</i>
from the authors in which he has been most
conversant; as water, from the beds of earths
or minerals, it hath happened to run over.
Especially such authors, as are studied and
even got by heart by us in our early youth,
leave a lasting impression, which is hardly
ever effaced out of the mind. Hence a certain
constrained and unoriginal air, in some degree
or other, in every genius, throughly disciplined
by a <i>course of learned education</i>. Which, by
the way, leads to a question, not very absurd
in itself, however it may pass with most readers
for paradoxical, viz. “<i>Whether the usual
forms of learning be not rather injurious to
the true poet, than really assisting to him?</i>”
It should seem to be so for a <i>natural reason</i>.
For the faculty of <i>invention</i>, as all our other
powers, is much improved and strengthened
by exercise. And great reading prevents this,
by demanding the perpetual exercise of the
<i>memory</i>. Thus the mind becomes not only
indisposed, but, for want of use, really unqualified,
to turn itself to other views, than
such as habitual recollection easily presents to
it. And this, I am persuaded, hath been the
case with many a fine genius, and especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
with <i>one</i> of our own country<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>; who, as appears
from some original efforts in the sublime
allegorical way, had no want of natural talents
for the greater poetry; which yet were so
restrained and disabled by his constant and
superstitious study of the old classics, that he
was, in fact, but a very ordinary poet.</p>

<p>2. But were early <i>habit</i> of less power to
incline the mind to <i>imitation</i>, than it really is,
yet the high hand of <i>authority</i> would compel
it. For the first originals in the several species
of poetry, like the Autocthones of old, were
deemed to have come into the world by a kind
of miracle. They were perfect prodigies, at
least reputed so by the admiring multitude,
from their first appearance. So that their authority,
in a short time, became sacred; and
succeeding writers were obliged, at the hazard
of their fame, and as they dreaded the charge
of a presumptuous and <i>prophane libertinism</i>
in poetry, to take them for their guides and
models. Which is said even without the
licence of a figure; at least of <i>one</i> of them;
whom Cicero calls <i>the fountain and origin of
all</i> <small>DIVINE</small> <i>institutions</i><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>; and another, of elder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
and more reverend estimation, pronounces to
be ὁ θεὸς καὶ θεῶν προφήτης<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>·</p>

<p>And what is here observed of the <i>influence</i>
of these master spirits, whom the admiration
of antiquity hath placed at the head of the
poetic world, will, with some allowance, hold
also, of <i>that</i> of later, though less original
writers, whose uncommon merits have given
them a distinguished rank in it.</p>

<p>3. <i>Next</i>, (as it usually comes to pass in
other instances) what was, at first, imposed by
the rigour of <i>authority</i>, soon grew respectable
in <i>itself</i>, and was chosen for its own sake, as
a <i>virtue</i>, which deserved no small commendation.
For, when sober and enlightened criticism
began to inspect, at leisure, these miracles
of early invention, it presently acknowledged
them for the <i>best</i>, as well as the most <i>ancient</i>,
poetic models, and accordingly recommended,
or more properly enjoined them by rule, to
the imitation of all ages. The effect of this
criticism was clearly seen in the works of all
succeeding poets in the <i>same</i> language. But,
when a new and different one was to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
furnished with fresh <i>models</i>, it became much
more conspicuous. For, besides the same or
a still higher veneration of their <i>inventions</i>,
which the distance of place and time insensibly
procured to them, the grace of <i>novelty</i>, which
they would appear to have in another <i>language</i>,
was, now, a further inducement to copy them.
Hence we find it to be the utmost pride of the
<i>Roman</i> writers, such I mean as came the
nearest to them in the divinity of their genius,
to follow the practice, and emulate the virtues,
of the <i>Grecian</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>says <i>one</i> of the best of those writers, who yet
was only treading in the <i>footsteps</i> of his Grecian
masters.</p>

<p>But <i>another</i> was less reserved, and seemed
desirous of being taken notice of, as an express
<i>imitator</i>, without so much as laying in his
claim to this sort of originality, in a new language&mdash;in
multis versibus Virgilius fecit&mdash;non
surripiendi caus&acirc;, sed <i>palam</i> imitandi, <i>hoc
animo ut vellet agnosci</i>. <i>Sen. Suasor.</i> <small>III.</small></p>

<p>And, on the revival of these arts in later
times and more barbarous languages, the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
spirit appeared again, or rather superior honours
were paid to successful <i>imitation</i>. So
that what a polite French writer declares on
this head is, now, become the fixed opinion of
the learned in all countries. “C’est m&ecirc;me
donner une grace &agrave; ses ouvrages, que de les
orner de fragmens antiques. Des vers d’Horace
et de Virgile bien traduits, et mis en
œuvre &agrave; propos dans un po&euml;me Fran&ccedil;ois, y
font le m&ecirc;me effet que les statu&euml;s antiques
font dans la gallerie de Versailles. Les lecteurs
retrouvent avec plaisir, sous une nouvelle
forme, la pens&eacute;e, qui leur pl&ucirc;t autrefois
en Latin<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>.”</p>

<p>It should, further, be added, that this praise
of borrowing from the originals of <i>Greece</i> and
<i>Rome</i> is now extended to the imitation of great
<i>modern</i> authors. Every body applauds this
practice, where the imitation is of approved
writers in <i>different</i> languages. And even in
the <i>same</i> languages, when this liberty is taken
with the most ancient and venerable, it is not
denied to have its <i>grace</i> and merit.</p>

<p>4. But, besides these several incitements,
<i>similarity of genius</i>, alone, will, almost necessarily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
determine a writer to the studious
emulation of some other. For, though it is
with the <i>minds</i>, as the <i>faces</i> of men, that no
two are exactly and in every feature alike; yet
the general cast of their genius, as well as the
air and turn of the countenance, will frequently
be very <i>similar</i> in different persons. When
two such spirits approach, they run together
with eagerness and rapidity: the instinctive
bias of the mind towards <i>imitation</i> being now
quickened by <i>passion</i>. This is chiefly said in
respect of that uniformity of <i>style and manner</i>,
which, whenever we observe it in two writers,
we almost constantly charge to the account of
<i>imitation</i>. Indeed, where the resemblance
holds to the last degree of <i>minuteness</i>, or
where the <i>peculiarities</i>, only, of the model
are taken, there is ground enough for this suspicion.
For every original genius, however
consonant, in the main, to any other, has still
some distinct marks and characters of his own,
by which he may be distinguished; and to
copy <i>peculiarities</i>, when there is no appearance
of the same original spirit, which gave
birth to them, is manifest affectation. But
the question is put of such, whose <i>manner</i>
hath only a <i>general</i>, though strong, resemblance
to that of some other, and whose true
genius is above the suspicion of falling into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
trap of what Horace happily calls, <small>EXEMPLAR
VITIIS IMITABILE</small>. And of these it is perhaps
juster to say, that a previous correspondency
of <i>character</i> impelled to <i>imitate</i>, than that
imitation itself produced that correspondency
of <i>character</i>. At least (which is all my concern
it present) it will be allowed to incline
a writer strongly to <i>imitation</i>; and where a
congenial spirit appears to provoke him to it,
a candid critic will not be forward to turn this
circumstance to the dishonour of his <i>invention</i>.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, were every other consideration
out of the way, yet, oftentimes, the <i>very nature
of the poet’s theme</i> would oblige him to
a diligent <i>imitation</i> of preceding writers. I
do not mean this of such subjects, as suggest
and produce a necessary conformity of description,
whether purposely intended or not. This
hath been fully considered. But my meaning
is, that, when the greater provinces of poetry
have been, already, occupied, and its most
interesting scenes exhausted; or, rather, their
application to the uses of poetry determined
by great masters, it becomes, thenceforward,
unavoidable for succeeding writers to draw
from their sources. The law of probability
exacts this at their hands; and one may almost
affirm, that to <i>copy</i> them closely is to paint after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
<i>nature</i>. I shall explain myself by an instance
or two.</p>

<p>With regard to the religious opinions and
ceremonies of the Pagan world, the writings
of Homer, it is said and very truly, were “<i>the
standard of private belief, and the grand
directory of public worship</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>.” Whatever
liberty might have been taken with the rites
and gods of Paganism before his time, yet,
when he had given an exact description of
<i>both</i>, and had formed, to the satisfaction of
all, the established religion into a kind of <i>system</i>,
succeeding poets were obliged, of course,
to take their theology from him; and could no
longer be thought to write <i>justly and naturally</i>
of their Gods, than whilst their <i>descriptions</i>
conformed to the <i>authentic</i> delineations
of <i>Homer</i>. His relations, and even the <i>fictions</i>,
which his genius had raised on the
popular creed of elder Paganism, were now
the proper archetype of all <i>religious representations</i>.
And to speak of <i>these</i>, as given
<i>truly and originally</i>, is, in effect, to say, that
they were borrowed or rather transcribed from
the page of <i>that poet</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>And the same may be observed of <i>historical
facts</i>, as of <i>religious traditions</i>. For not
unfrequently, where the subject is taken from
authentic history, the authority of a preceding
poet is so prevalent, as to render <i>any</i> account
of the matter improbable, which is not
fashioned and regulated after his ideas. A
succeeding writer is neither at liberty to relate
matters of fact, which no one thinks <i>credible</i>,
nor to <i>feign</i> afresh for himself. In this case,
again, all that the most original genius has to
do, is to <i>imitate</i>. We have been told that
the <i>second book of the</i> <span class="smcap">Aeneis</span> was translated
from Pisander<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>. Another thinks, it was taken
from the <small>LITTLE ILIAD</small><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>. Or, why confine
him to either of these, when <span class="smcap">Metrodorus</span>,
<span class="smcap">Syagrus</span>, <span class="smcap">Hegesianax</span>, <span class="smcap">Aratus</span>, and others,
wrote poems on <i>the taking</i> of <span class="smcap">Troy</span>? But
granting the poet (as is most likely) to have
had these originals before him, what shall we
infer from it? Only this, that he took his
principal facts and circumstances (as we see
he was obliged to do for the sake of <i>probability</i>)
from these writers. And why should
this be thought a greater crime in him, than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
in <span class="smcap">Polygnotus</span>; who, in his famous picture
on this subject, was under the necessity, and
for the same reason, of collecting his <i>subject-matter</i>
from several poets<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>?</p>

<p>It follows, from these considerations, that
we cannot justify ourselves in thinking so
hardly, as we commonly do, of the class of
<i>imitators</i>; which is, now, by the concurrence
of various circumstances, become the necessary
character of almost all poets. Nor let it be
any concern to the <i>true</i> poet, that it is so.
For <i>imitations</i>, when real and confessed, may
still have their merit; nay, I presume to add,
sometimes a <i>greater</i> merit, than the very originals
on which they are formed: And, with
the reader’s leave (though I am hastening to a
conclusion of this long discourse), I will detain
him, one moment, with the reasons of this
opinion.</p>

<p>After all the praises that are deservedly given
to the novelty of a <i>subject</i>, or the beauty of
<i>design</i>, the supreme merit of poetry, and that
which more especially immortalizes the writers
of it, lies in the <i>execution</i>. It is thus that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the poets of the Augustan age have not so
properly excelled, as discredited, all the productions
of their predecessors; and that those
of the age of Louis XIV<sup>th</sup> not only obscure,
but will in process of time obliterate, the fame
and memory of the elder French writers. Or,
to see the effect of masterly execution in single
instances, hence it is, that Lucilius not only
yields to Horace, but would be almost forgotten
by us, if it had not been for the honour
his imitator has done him. And nobody needs
be told the advantage which Pope is likely to
have over all our older satirists, excellent as
some of them are, and more entitled than he
to the honour of being inventors. We have
here, then, an established <i>fact</i>. The first
essays of genius, though ever so original, are
overlooked; while the later productions of
men, who had never risen to such distinction
but by means of the very originals they disgrace,
obtain the applause and admiration of
all ages.</p>

<p>The solution of this <i>fact</i>, so notorious, and,
at the same time, so contrary, in appearance,
to the honours which men are disposed to pay
to original invention, will open the mystery
of that matter we are now considering.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>The faculties, or, as we may almost term
them, the magic powers, which <i>ope the palace
of eternity</i> to great writers, are a <i>confirmed
judgment</i>, and <i>ready invention</i>.</p>

<p>Now the <i>first</i> is seen to most advantage, in
selecting, out of all preceding stores, the particulars
that are most suited to the nature of
a poet’s work, and the ends of poetry. When
true genius has exhausted, as it were, the
various <i>manners</i>, in which a work of art may
be conducted, and the various <i>topics</i> which
may be employed to adorn it, <i>judgment</i> is in
its province, or rather sovereignty, when it
determines which of all these is to be preferred,
and which neglected. In this sense, as well
as others, it will be most true, <i>Qu&ograve;d artis pars
magna contineatur imitatione</i>.</p>

<p>Nay, by means of this discernment, the very
<i>topic</i> or method, which had no effect, or perhaps
an ill one, under one management, or in
one situation, shall charm every reader, in
another. And by force of <i>judging right</i>, the
copier shall almost lose his title, and become
an inventor:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tantum <i>de medio</i> sumptis accedit honoris.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>But imitation, though it give most room to
the display of judgment, does not exclude the
exercise of the other faculty, <i>invention</i>. Nay,
it requires the most dextrous, perhaps the
most difficult, exertion of this faculty. For
consider how the case stands. When we
speak of an <i>imitator</i>, we do not speak, as the
poet says, of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A barren-spirited fellow, one who feeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On abject orts, and imitations&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>but of one, who, in aiming to be like, contends
also to be equal to his original. To
attain to this <i>equality</i>, it is not enough that
he select the best of those stores which are
ready prepared to his hand (for thus he would
be rather a skilful borrower, than a successful
imitator); but, in taking something from
others, he must add much of his own: he
must improve the <i>expression</i>, where it is defective
or barely passable: he must throw fresh
lights of fancy on a common <i>image</i>: he must
strike out new hints from a vulgar <i>sentiment</i>.
Thus, he will complete his original, where he
finds it <i>imperfect</i>: he will supply its <i>omissions</i>:
he will emulate, or rather surpass, its highest
<i>beauties</i>. Or, in despair of this last, we shall
find him taking a different <i>route</i>; giving us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
an equivalent in a beauty of another kind,
which yet he extracts from some latent intimation
of his author; or, where his purpose
requires the very same representation, giving
it a new form, perhaps a nobler, by the turn
of his application.</p>

<p>But all this requires not only the truest
judgment, but the most delicate operation of
inventive genius. And, where they both meet
in a supreme degree, we sometimes find an
admired original, not only excelled by his
imitator, but almost discredited. Of which,
if there were no other, the sixth book of Virgil,
I mean taking it in the light of an <i>imitation</i>,
is an immortal instance.</p>

<p>Thus much I could not forbear saying on
the <i>merit</i> of successful imitation. As to the
<i>necessity</i> of the thing, hear the apology of a
great Poet, for himself. “All that is left us,
says this original writer, is to recommend
our productions by the imitation of the ancients:
and it will be found true, that, in
every age, the highest character for sense
and learning has been obtained by those who
have been the most indebted to them. For,
to say truth, whatever is very good sense,
must have been common sense in all times;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
and what we call learning is but the knowledge
of our predecessors. Therefore they
who say our thoughts are not our own, because
they resemble the ancients, may as
well say, our faces are not our own, because
they are like our fathers: and indeed it is
very unreasonable, that people should expect
us to be scholars, and yet be angry to find
us so<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>.”</p>

<p>He adds, “<i>I fairly confess, that I have
served myself all I could by reading</i>:” where
the good sense of the <i>practice</i>, is as conspicuous,
as the ingenuity, so becoming the greatness of
his character, in <i>confessing</i> it. For, when a
writer, who, as we have seen, is driven by so
many powerful motives to the imitation of preceding
models, revolts against them all, and
determines, at any rate, to be <i>original</i>, nothing
can be expected but an aukward straining
in every thing. <i>Improper method</i>, <i>forced
conceits</i>, and <i>affected expression</i>, are the certain
issue of such obstinacy. The business is
to be <i>unlike</i>; and this he may very possibly
be, but at the expence of graceful ease and
true beauty. For he puts himself, at best,
into a convulsed, unnatural state; and it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
well, if he be not forced, beside his purpose,
to leave <i>common sense</i>, as well as his <i>model</i>,
behind him. Like one who would break
loose from an impediment, which holds him
fast; the very endeavour to get clear of it
throws him into <i>uneasy attitudes</i>, and <i>violent
contorsions</i>; and, if he gain his liberty at
last, it is by an <i>effort</i>, which carries him
much further than the <i>point</i> he would wish
to stop at.</p>

<p>And, that the reader may not suspect me
of asserting this without experience, let me
exemplify what has been here said in the case
of a very eminent person, who, with all the
advantages of art and nature that could be
required to adorn the true poet, was ruined
by this single error. The person I mean was
Sir <span class="smcap">William D’Avenant</span>; whose <i>Gondibert</i>
will remain a perpetual monument of the
mischiefs, which must ever arise from this
affectation of originality in lettered and polite
poets.</p>

<p>The great author, when he projected his
plan of an heroic poem, was so far from intending
to steer his course by <i>example</i>, that
he sets out, in his preface, with upbraiding
the followers of Homer, as a base and timorous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
crew of <i>coasters</i>, who would not adventure to
launch forth on the vast ocean of invention.
For, speaking of this poet, he observes, “that,
as sea marks are chiefly used to coasters,
and serve not those who have the ambition
of discoverers, that love to sail in untried
seas; so he hath rather proved a guide for
those, whose satisfied wit will not venture
beyond the track of others; than to them,
who affect a new and remote way of thinking;
who esteem it a deficiency and meanness of
mind, to stay and depend upon the authority
of example<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>.”</p>

<p>And, afterwards, he professedly makes his
own merit to consist in “an endeavour to lead
truth through unfrequented and new ways,
and from the most remote shades; by representing
nature, though not in an affected,
yet in an unusual dress<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.” These were the
principles he went upon: let us now attend to
the success of his endeavours.</p>

<p>The <small>METHOD</small> of his work is defective in
many respects. To instance in the two following.
Observing the large compass of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
ancient epic, for which he saw no cause in
nature, and which, he supposed, had been
followed merely from a blind deference to the
authority of the first model, he resolved to
construct an heroic poem on the narrower and,
as he conceived, juster plan of the dramatic
poets. And, because it was their practice, for
the purpose of <i>raising the passions</i> by a close
accelerated plot, and for the convenience of
<i>representation</i>, to conclude their subject in
<i>five acts</i>, he affects to restrain himself within
the same limits. The event was, that, cutting
himself off, by this means, from the opportunity
of digressive ornaments, which contribute
so much to the pomp of the epic poetry; and,
what is more essential, from the advantage of
the most gradual and circumstantiated narration,
which gives an air of <i>truth and reality</i>
to the fable, he failed in accomplishing the
proper <i>end</i> of this poem, <small>ADMIRATION</small>; <i>produced</i>
by a grandeur of design and variety of
important incidents, and <i>sustained</i> by all the
energy and minute particularity of description.</p>

<p>2. It was essential to the ancient epos to
raise and exalt the fable by the intervention of
<i>supernatural agency</i>. This, again, the poet
mistook for the prejudice of the affected imitators
of Homer, “who had so often led them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
into heaven and hell, till, by conversation
with gods and ghosts, they sometimes deprive
us of those natural probabilities in
story, which are instructive to human life<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>.”
Here then he would needs be original; and so,
by recording only the affairs of men, hath
fairly omitted a necessary part of the epic plan,
and that which, of all others, had given the
greatest state and magnificence to its construction.
Yet here, to do him justice, one thing
deserves our commendation. It had been the
way of the Italian romancers, who were at that
time the best poets, to run very much into
prodigy and enchantment. “Not only to
exceed the <i>work</i>, but also the <i>possibility</i> of
nature, they would have impenetrable armors,
inchanted castles, invulnerable bodies, iron
men, flying horses, and a thousand other
such things, which are easily feigned by
them that dare<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.” These conceits, he rightly
saw, had too slender a foundation in the serious
belief of his age to justify a relation of them.
And had he only dropped these, his conduct
had been without blame. But, as it is the
weakness of human nature, the observation of
this extreme determined him to the other, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
admitting nothing, however well established in
the general opinion, that was <i>supernatural</i>.</p>

<p>And as here he did too much, so in another
respect, it may be observed, he did too little.
The romancers, before spoken of, had carried
their notions of <i>gallantry</i> in ordinary life, as
high, as they had done those of <i>preternatural
agency</i>, in their marvellous fictions. Yet here
this original genius, who was not to be held
by the shackles of superstition, suffered himself
to be entrapped in the silken net of <i>love
and honour</i>. And so hath adopted, in his
draught of <i>characters</i>, that elevation of sentiment
which a change of manners could not but
dispose the reader to regard as <i>fantastic</i> in the
Gothic romance, at the same time that he rejected
what had the truest grace in the ancient
epic, a <i>sober intermixture of religion</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>execution</i> of his poem was answerable
to the general <i>method</i>. His <small>SENTIMENTS</small> are
frequently forced, and so tortured by an affectation
of wit, that every stanza hath the air of
an epigram. And the <small>EXPRESSION</small>, in which he
cloaths them, is so quaint and figurative, as turns
his description almost into a continued riddle.</p>

<p>Such was the effect of a studious affectation
of <i>originality</i> in a writer, who, but for this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
misconduct, had been in the first rank of our
poets. His endeavour was to keep clear of the
models, in which his youth had been instructed,
and which he perfectly understood. And in
this indeed he succeeded. But the success lost
him the possession of, what his large soul appears
to have been full of, a true and permanent
glory; which hath ever arisen, and can only
arise, from the unambitious simplicity of nature;
<i>contemplated</i> in her own proper form,
or, by <i>reflexion</i>, in the faithful mirror of those
very models, he so much dreaded.</p>

<p>In short, from what hath been here advanced,
and especially as confirmed by so uncommon
an instance, I think myself entitled to come at
once to this <i>general conclusion</i>, which they,
who have a comprehensive view of the history
of letters, in their several periods, and a just
discernment to estimate their state in them, will
hardly dispute with me, “that, though many
causes concur to produce a thorough degeneracy
of taste in any country; yet the <i>principal</i>,
ever, is, <small>THIS ANXIOUS DREAD OF IMITATION
IN POLITE AND CULTIVATED WRITERS</small>.”</p>

<p>And, if such be the case, among the other
uses of this Essay, it may perhaps serve for a
seasonable admonition to the poets of our time,
to relinquish their vain hopes of <i>originality</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and turn themselves to a stricter imitation of
the best models. I say, a <i>seasonable admonition</i>;
for the more polished a nation is, and
the more generally these models are understood,
the greater danger there is, as was now observed,
of running into that worst of literary
faults, <i>affectation</i>. But, to stimulate their
endeavours to this practice, the judgment of
the public should first be set right; and their
readers prepared to place a just value upon it.
In this respect, too, I would willingly contribute,
in some small degree, to the service of
letters. For the poet, whose object is <i>fame</i>,
will always adapt himself to the humour of
those, who confer it. And till the public taste
be reduced, by sober criticism, to a just
standard, strength of genius will only enable
a writer to pervert it still further, by a too
successful compliance with its vicious expectations.

<h3>TO MR. MASON.</h3>

<p>I have said, in the discourse on <span class="smcap">Poetical
Imitation</span>, “that coincidencies of a certain
<i>kind</i>, and in a certain <i>degree</i>, cannot fail to
convict a writer of Imitation<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.” You are curious,
my friend, to know what these <i>coincidencies</i>
are, and have thought that an attempt
to point them out would furnish an useful
Supplement to what I have written on this
subject. But the just execution of this design
would require, besides a careful examination
of the workings of the human mind, an exact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
scrutiny of the most original and most imitative
writers. And, with all your partiality for me,
can you, in earnest, think me capable of fulfilling
the <i>first</i> of these conditions; Or, if I
were, do you imagine that, at this time o’ day,
I can have the leisure to perform the <i>other</i>?
My younger years, indeed, have been spent in
turning over those authors which young men are
most fond of; and among these I will not disown
that the Poets of ancient and modern fame
have had their full share in my affection. But
you, who love me so well, would not wish
me to pass more of my life in these flowery
regions; which though you may yet wander
in without offence, and the rather as you
wander in them with so pure a mind and to so
moral a purpose, there seems no decent pretence
for me to loiter in them any longer.</p>

<p>Yet in saying this I would not be thought
to assume that severe character; which, though
sometimes the garb of reason, is oftener, I
believe, the mask of dulness, or of something
worse. No, I am too sensible to the charms,
nay to the uses of your profession, to affect a
contempt for it. The great Roman said well,
<i>Haec studia adolescentiam alunt; senectutem
oblectant</i>. We make a full meal of them in
our youth. And no philosophy requires so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
perfect a mortification as that we should wholly
abstain from them in our riper years. But
should we invert the observation; and take
this light food not as the refreshment only, but
as the proper <i>nourishment</i> of Age; such a
name as Cicero’s, I am afraid, would be
wanting, and not easily found, to justify the
practice.</p>

<p>Let us own then, on a greater authority than
His, “That every thing is beautiful in its
season.” The Spring hath its <i>buds and
blossoms</i>: But, as the year runs on, you are
not displeased, perhaps, to see them fall off;
and would certainly be disappointed not to find
them, in due time, succeeded by those <i>mellow
hangings</i>, the poet somewhere speaks of.</p>

<p>I could alledge still graver reasons. But I
would only say, in one word, that your friend
has had his share in these amusements. I may
recollect with pleasure, but must never live
over again</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pieriosque dies, et amantes carmina somnos.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet something, you insist, is to be done; and,
if it amount to no more than a specimen or
slight sketch, such as my memory, or the few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
notes I have by me, would furnish, the design,
you think, is not totally to be relinquished.</p>

<p>I understand the danger of gratifying you on
these terms. Yet, whatever it be, I have no
power to excuse myself from any attempt, by
which, you tell me at least, I may be able to
gratify you. I will do my best, then, to draw
together such observations, as I have sometimes
thought, in reading the poets, most material
for the certain discovery of <i>Imitations</i>. And
I address them to <small>YOU</small>, not only as you are
the properest judge of the subject; you, who
understand so well in what manner the Poets
are us’d to imitate each other, and who yourself
so finely imitate the best of them; But as
I would give you this small proof of my affection,
and have perhaps the ambition of publishing
to the world in this way the entire
friendship, that subsists between us.</p>

<p>You tell me I have not succeeded amiss in
explaining the difficulty of detecting <i>Imitations</i>.
The materials of poetry, you own, lie
so much in common amongst all writers, and
the several ways of employing them are so much
under the controul of common sense, that
writings will in many respects be similar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
where there is no thought or design of <i>Imitating</i>.
I take advantage of this concession
to conclude from it, That we can seldom pronounce
with certainty of Imitations without
some external proof to assist us in the discovery.
You will understand me to mean by
these <i>external proofs</i>, the previous knowledge
we have, from considerations not respecting
the <i>Nature</i> of the work itself, of the writer’s
<i>ability</i> or <i>inducements</i> to imitate. Our first
enquiry, then, will be, concerning the <i>Age</i>,
<i>Character</i>, and <i>Education</i> of the supposed
Imitator.</p>

<p>We can determine with little certainty, how
far the principal Greek writers have been indebted
to Imitation. We trace the waters of
Helicon no higher than to their source. And
we acquiesce, with reason, in the device of
the old painter, you know of, who somewhat
rudely indeed, but not absurdly, drew the
figure of Homer with a fountain streaming
out of his mouth, and the other poets watering
at it.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hither, as to their fountain, other Stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repairing, in their golden urns draw light.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Greek writers then were, or, for any
thing we can say, might be Original.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>But we can rarely affirm this of any other.
And the reason is plain. When a taste for
letters prevailed in any country, if it arose at
first from the efforts of original thinking, it
was immediately cherished and cultivated by
the study of the old writers. You are too well
acquainted with the progress of ancient and
modern wit to doubt of this fact. Rome adorned
itself in the spoils of Greece. And both assisted
in dressing up the later European poetry.
What else do you find in the Italian or French
Wits, but the old matter, worked over again;
only presented to us in a new form, and embellished
perhaps with a conceit or two of
mere modern invention?</p>

<p>But the English, you say, or rather your
fondness for your Masters leads you to suppose,
are original thinkers. ’Tis true, Nature
has taken a pleasure to shew us what she could
do, by the production of <small>ONE</small> Prodigy. But
the rest are what we admire them for, not
indeed without Genius, perhaps with a larger
share of it than has fallen to the lot of others,
yet directly and chiefly by the discipline of art
and the helps of imitation.</p>

<p>The golden times of the English Poetry
were, undoubtedly, the reigns of our two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Queens. Invention was at its height, in the <i>one</i>;
and Correctness, in the <i>other</i>. In <i>both</i>, the manners
of a court refin’d, without either breaking
or corrupting the spirit of our poets. But do
you forget that <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> read Greek and
Latin almost as easily as our Professors? And
can you doubt that what she knew so well,
would be known, admired, and imitated by
every other? Or say, that the writers of her
time were, some of them, ignorant enough of
the <i>learned</i> languages to be inventors; can you
suppose, from what you know of the fashion
of that age, that their fancies would not be
sprinkled, and their wits refreshed by the
essences of the Italian poetry?</p>

<p>I scarcely need say a word of our <small>OTHER</small>
Queen, whose reign was unquestionably the
&aelig;ra of classic imitation and of classic taste.
Even they, who had never been as far as
Greece or Italy, to warm their imaginations
or stock their memories, might do both to a
tolerable degree in France; which, though it
bowed to our country’s arms, had almost the
ascendant in point of letters.</p>

<p>I mention these things only to put you in
mind that hardly <i>one</i> of our poets has been in
a condition to do without, or certainly be above,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the suspicion of learned imitation. And the
observation is so true, that even in this our
age, when good letters, they say, are departing
from us, the Greek or Roman stamp is still
visible in every work of genius, that has taken
with the public. Do you think one needed to
be told in the title-page, that a late <span class="smcap">Drama</span>,
or some later <span class="smcap">Odes</span> were formed on the ancient
model?</p>

<p>The drift of all this, you will say, is to overturn
the former discourse; for that now I pretend,
every degree of likeness to a preceding
writer is an argument of imitation. Rather,
if you please, conclude that, in my opinion,
every degree of likeness is exposed to the <i>suspicion</i>
of imitation. To convert this suspicion
into a proof, it is not enough to say, that a
writer <i>might</i>, but that his circumstances make
it plain or probable at least, that he <i>did</i>, imitate.</p>

<p>Of these <i>circumstances</i> then, the <i>first</i> I
should think deserving our attention, is the
<small>AGE</small> in which the writer lived. One should
know if it were an age addicted to much study,
and in which it was creditable for the best
writers to make a shew of their reading. Such
especially was the age succeeding to that memorable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
&aelig;ra, the revival of letters in these
western countries. The fashion of the time
was to interweave as much of ancient wit as
possible in every new work. Writers were so
far from affecting to think and speak in their
own way, that it was their pride to make the
admired ancient think and speak for them.
This humour continued very long, and in
some sort even still continues: with this difference
indeed, that, then, the ancients were
introduced to do the honours, since, to do the
drudgery of the entertainment. But several
causes conspired to carry it to its height in
England about the beginning of the last century.
You may be sure, then, the writers of
that period abound in imitations. The best
poets boasted of them as their sovereign excellence.
And you will easily credit, for instance,
that B. Jonson was a servile imitator, when
you find him on so many occasions little better
than a painful translator.</p>

<p>I foresee the occasion I shall have, in the
course of this letter, to weary you with citations:
and would not therefore go out of my
way for them. Yet, amidst a thousand instances
of this sort in Jonson, the following,
I fancy, will entertain you. The Latin verses,
you know, are of Catullus.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ut flos in septis secretus nascitur hortis,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nulli illum pueri, null&aelig; optavere puell&aelig;.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It came in Jonson’s way, in one of his masks,
to translate this passage; and observe with
what industry he has secured the sense, while
the spirit of his author escapes him.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;It was not thus, you remember, that Ariosto
and Pope have translated these fine verses.
But to return to our purpose:</p>

<p>To this consideration of the <i>Age</i> of a writer,
you may add, if you please, that of his <span class="smcap">Education</span>.
Though it might not, in general, be
the fashion to affect learning, the habits acquired
by a particular writer might dispose
him to do so. What was less esteemed by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
enthusiasts of Milton’s time (of which however
he himself was one of the greatest) than prophane
or indeed any kind of learning? Yet we,
who know that his youth was spent in the
study of the best writers in every language,
want but little evidence to convince us that his
great genius did not disdain to stoop to imitation.
You assent, I dare say, to Dryden’s
compliment, though it be an invidious one,
“That no man has so copiously translated
Homer’s Grecisms, and the Latin elegancies
of Virgil.” Nay, don’t you remember, the
other day, that we were half of a mind to give
him up for a shameless plagiary, chiefly because
we were sure he had been a great reader.</p>

<p>But no good writer, it will be said, has
flourished out of a learned age, or at least
without some tincture of learning. It may be
so. Yet every writer is not disposed to make
the most of these advantages. What if we pay
some regard then to the <small>CHARACTER</small> of the
writer? A poet, enamoured of himself, and
who sets up for a great inventive genius, thinks
much to profit by the sense of his predecessors,
and even when he steals, takes care to dissemble
his thefts, and to conceal them as much as possible.
You know I have instanced in such a
poet in Sir <i>William D’Avenant</i>. In detecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the imitations of such a writer, one must then
proceed with some caution. But what if our
concern be with <i>one</i>, whose modesty leads him
to revere the sense and even the expression of
approved authors, whose taste enables him to
select the finest passages in their works, and
whose judgment determines him to make a free
use of them? Suppose we know all this from
common fame, and even from his own confession;
would you scruple to call that an <i>imitation</i>
in him, which in the other might have
passed for <i>resemblance</i> only?</p>

<p>As the character is amiable, you will be
pleased to hear me own, there are many modern
poets to whom it belongs. Perhaps, the
first that occurred to my thoughts was Mr.
Addison. But the observation holds of others,
and of <i>one</i>, in particular, very much his superior
in true genius. I know not whether you
agree with me, that the famous line in the
<i>Essay on Man</i>;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“An honest man’s the noblest work of God,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is taken from Plato’s, Πάντων ἱερώτατόν ἐστιν
ἄνθρωπος ὁ ἀγαθός. But I am sure you will
that the still more famous lines, which shallow
men repeat without understanding,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237a">237*</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For modes of Faith let graceless zealots fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His, can’t be wrong whose life is in the right:”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>are but copied, though with vast improvement
in the force and turn of expression, from the
excellent and, let it be no disparagement to
him to say, from the orthodox Mr. Cowley.
The poet is speaking of his friend <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="a">
<span class="i0">“His Faith perhaps in some nice tenets might<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be wrong; his life, I’m sure, was in the right.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Pope, who found himself in the same
circumstances with Crashaw, and had suffered
no doubt from the like uncharitable constructions
of <i>graceless zeal</i>, was very naturally
tempted to adopt this candid sentiment, and
to give it the further heightening of his own
spirited expression.</p>

<p>Let us see then how far we are got in this
inquiry. We may say of the old Latin poets,
that they all came out of the Greek schools.
It is as true of the moderns in this part of the
world, that they, in general, have had their
breeding in both the Greek and Latin. But
when the question is of any particular writer,
how far and in what instances you may presume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238a">238*</span>
on his being a professed imitator, much will
depend on the certain knowledge you have of
his <i>Age</i>, <i>Education</i>, and <i>Character</i>. When
all these circumstances meet in one man, as
they have done in others, but in none perhaps
so eminently as in B. Jonson, wherever you
find an acknowledged likeness, you will do
him no injustice to call it <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>Yet all this, you say, comes very much short
of what you require of me. You want me to
specify those peculiar considerations, and even
to reduce them into rule, from which one may
be authorised, in any instance to pronounce of
imitations. It is not enough, you pretend, to
say of any passage in a celebrated poet, that it
most probably was taken from some other. In
your extreme jealousy for the credit of your
order, you call upon me to shew the distinct
marks which convict him of this commerce.</p>

<p>In a word, You require me to turn to the
poets; to gather a number of those passages I
call Imitations; and to point to the <i>circumstances</i>
in each that prove them to be so. I
attend you with pleasure in this amusing
search. It is not material, I suppose, that we
observe any strict method in our ramblings.
And yet we will not wholly neglect it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239a">239*</span></p>

<p>Perhaps then we shall find undoubted marks
of Imitation, both in the <span class="smcap">Sentiment</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Expression</span> of great writers.</p>

<p>To begin with such considerations as are
most <small>GENERAL</small>.</p>

<p>I. An identity of the <i>subject-matter</i> of
poetry is no sure evidence of Imitation: and
least of all, perhaps, in natural description.
Yet where the <i>local</i> peculiarities of nature are
to be described, there an exact conformity of
the matter will evince an imitation.</p>

<p>Descriptive poets have ever been fond of
lavishing all the riches of their fancy on the
<i>Spring</i>. But the appearances of this <i>prime of
the year</i> are so diversified with the climate,
that descriptions of it, if taken directly from
nature, must needs be very different. The
Greek and Latin, and, since them, the Provencial
poets, when they insist, as they always
do, on the indulgent softness of this season, its
<i>genial dews</i> and <i>fostering breezes</i>, speak nothing
but what is agreeable to their own experience
and feeling.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It ver; et Venus; et Veneris praenuntius ant&egrave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pinnatus graditur Zephyrus vestigia propter:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240a">240*</span>
<span class="i0">Flora quibus mater praespergens ant&egrave; via&iuml;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuncta coloribus egregiis et odoribus opplet.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Venus, or the spirit of love, is represented
by those poets as brooding o’er this delicious
season;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rura foecundat voluptas: rura <span class="smcap">Venerem</span> sentiunt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ipsa gemmas purpurantem pingit annum floribus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ipsa surgentis papillas de Favon&icirc; spiritu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urguet in toros tepentes; ipsa roris lucidi, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and a great deal more to the same purpose,
which every one recollects in the old classic
and in the Provencial poets.</p>

<p>But when we hear this language from the
more Northern, and particularly our English
bards, who perhaps are shivering with the
blasts of the North-east, at the very time their
imagination would warm itself with these notions,
one is certain this cannot be the effect
of <i>observation</i>, but of a sportful fancy; enchanted
by the native loveliness of these exotic
images, and charmed by the secret insensible
power of <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>And to shew the certainty of this conclusion,
Shakespear, we may observe, who had none of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241a">241*</span>
this classical or Provencial bias on his mind,
always describes, not a Greek, or Italian, or
Provencial, but an English Spring; where we
meet with many unamiable characters; and,
among the rest, instead of Zephyr or Favonius,
we have the bleak North-east, that <i>nips the
blooming infants of the Spring</i>.</p>

<p>But there are other obvious examples. In
Cranmer’s prophetic speech, at the end of
<span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span> when the poet makes him say of
Queen Elizabeth, that,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In her days ev’ry man shall eat with safety<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Under his own vine what he plants.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and of King James, that,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“He shall flourish,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a mountain Cedar, reach his branches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all the plains about him”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is easy to see that his <i>Vine</i> and <i>Cedar</i> are
not of English growth, but transplanted from
Jud&aelig;a. I do not mention this as an impropriety
in the poet, who, for the greater solemnity
of his prediction, and even from a principle
of decorum, makes his Arch-bishop fetch
his imagery from Scripture. I only take notice
of it as a certain argument that the imagery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242a">242*</span>
was not his own, that is, not suggested by his
own observation of nature.</p>

<p>The case you see, in these instances, is the
same as if an English landskip-painter should
choose to decorate his Scene with an Italian
sky. The Connoisseur would say, he had
copied this particular from Titian, and not
from Nature. I presume then to give it for a
certain note of Imitation, <i>when the properties
of one clime are given to another</i>.</p>

<p>II. You will draw the same conclusion
whenever you find “The Genius of one <i>people</i>
given to another.”</p>

<p>1. Plautus gives us the following true picture
of the Greek manners:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;In hominum aetate multa eveniunt hujusmodi&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irae interveniunt, redeunt rursum in gratiam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ver&ugrave;m irae siquae fort&egrave; eveniunt hujusmodi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inter eos rursum si reventum in gratiam est,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bis tanto amici sunt inter se, qu&agrave;m prius.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Amphyt.</span> A. <small>III.</small> S. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>You are better acquainted with the modern
Italian writers than I am; but if ever you find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243a">243*</span>
any of them transferring this placability of
temper into an eulogy of his countrymen,
conclude without hesitation, that the sentiment
is taken.</p>

<p>2. The late Editor of Jonson’s works observes
very well the impropriety of leaving a
trait of Italian manners in his <i>Every man in
his humour</i>, when he fitted up that Play with
English characters. Had the scene been laid
originally in England, and that <i>trait</i> been
given us, it had convicted the poet of <i>Imitation</i>.</p>

<p>3. This attention to the genius of a people
will sometimes shew you, that the <i>form</i> of
composition, as well as particular sentiments,
comes from Imitation. An instance occurs to
me as I am writing. The Greeks, you know,
were great haranguers. So were the ancient
Romans, but in a less degree. One is not
surprized therefore that their historians abound
in set speeches; which, in their hands, become
the finest parts of their works. But when
you find modern writers indulging in this
practice of speech-making, you may guess
from what source the habit is derived. Would
Machiavel, for instance, as little of a Scholar
as, they say, he was, have adorned his fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244a">244*</span>
history of Florence with so many harangues,
if the classical bias, imperceptibly, it may be,
to himself, had not hung on his mind?</p>

<p>Another example is remarkable. You have
sometimes wondered how it has come to pass
that the moderns delight so much in <i>dialogue-writing</i>,
and yet that so very few have succeeded
in it. The proper answer to the first
part of your enquiry will go some way towards
giving you satisfaction as to the last. The
practice is not original, has no foundation in
the manners of modern times. It arose from
the excellence of the Greek and Roman dialogues,
which was the usual form in which the
ancients chose to deliver their sentiments on
any subject.</p>

<p>Still another instance comes in my way.
How happened it, one may ask, that Sir
<span class="smcap">Philip Sydney</span> in his Arcadia, and afterwards
<span class="smcap">Spenser</span> in his Fairy Queen, observed so unnatural
a conduct in those works; in which
the Story proceeds, as it were, by snatches,
and with continual interruptions? How was the
good sense of those writers, so conversant besides
in the best models of antiquity, seduced into
this preposterous method? The answer, no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245a">245*</span>
doubt, is, that they were copying the design,
or disorder rather, of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, the favourite
poet of that time.</p>

<p>III. Of near akin to this contrariety <i>to the
genius of a people</i> is another mark which a
careful reader will observe “in the representation
of certain <span class="smcap">Tenets</span>, different from those
which prevail in a writer’s country or time.”</p>

<p>1. We seldom are able to fasten an imitation,
with certainty, on such a writer as
Shakespear. Sometimes we are, but never to
so much advantage as when he happens to
forget himself in this respect. When Claudio,
in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, pleads for his life in
that famous speech,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lye in cold obstruction, and to rot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sensible warm motion to become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be imprison’d in the viewless winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blown with restless violence about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pendant world&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is plain that these are not the Sentiments
which any man entertained of <i>Death</i> in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246a">246*</span>
writer’s age or in that of the speaker. We see
in this passage a mixture of Christian and
Pagan ideas; all of them very susceptible of
poetical ornament, and conducive to the argument
of the Scene; but such as Shakespear
had never dreamt of but for Virgil’s Platonic
hell; where, as we read,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>2. A prodigiously fine passage in Milton
may furnish another example of this sort,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">When Lust<br /></span>

<span class="author"><i>Mask at Ludlow Castle.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247a">247*</span></p>

<p>This philosophy of <i>imbruted souls</i> becoming
<i>thick shadows</i> is so remote from any ideas entertained
at present of the effects of Sin, and
at the same time is so agreeable to the notions
of Plato (a double favourite of Milton, for his
own sake, and for the sake of his being a
favourite with his Italian Masters), that there
is not the least question of its being taken from
the <span class="smcap">Phaedo</span>.</p>

<p>Ἡ τοιαύτη ψυχὴ βαρύνεταί τε καὶ ἕλκεται
πάλιν εἰς τὸν ὁρατὸν τόπον, φόβῳ τοῦ ἀειδοῦς τε

φαντάσματα, οἷα παρέχονται αἱ τοιαῦται ψυχαὶ
εἴδωλα, αἱ μὴ καθαρῶς ἀπολυθεῖσαι&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There is no wonder, now one sees the fountain
Milton drew from, that, in admiration of
this poetical philosophy (which nourished the
fine spirits of that time, though it corrupted
some), he should make the other speaker in
the scene cry out, as in a fit of extasy,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How charming is divine philosophy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not harsh, and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And a perpetual feast of nectar’d sweets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where no crude surfeit reigns&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The very ideas which Lord <span class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span> has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248a">248*</span>
employed in his encomiums on the Platonic
philosophy; and the very language which Dr.
<span class="smcap">Henry More</span> would have used, if he had
known to express himself so soberly.</p>

<p>3. Having said so much of Plato, whom the
Italian writers have helped to make known to
us, let me just observe one thing, to our present
purpose, of those Italian writers themselves.
One of their peculiarities, and almost
the first that strikes us, is a certain sublime
mystical air which runs through all their fictions.
We find them a sort of philosophical
fanatics, indulging themselves in strange conceits
“concerning the <i>Soul</i>, the <i>chyming of
celestial orbs</i>, and presiding <i>Syrens</i>.” One
may tell by these marks, that they doted on
the fancies of Plato; if we had not, besides,
direct evidence for this conclusion. Tasso
says of himself, and he applauds the same
thing in Petrarch, “Lessi gi&agrave; tutte l’opere di
Platone, &egrave; mi rimassero molti semi nella
menta della sua dottrina.” I take these
words from Menage, who has much more to
the same purpose, in his elegant observations
on the <i>Amintas</i> of this poet.</p>

<p>One sees then where Milton had been for
that imagery in the <span class="smcap">Arcades</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249a">249*</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">then listen I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the celestial Syrens’ harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sit upon the nine enfolded spheres<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing to those that hold the vital shears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn the adamantine spindle round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which the fate of Gods and men is wound.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The best comment on these verses is a passage
in the x<sup>th</sup> Book of Plato’s Republic, where
this whole system, of <i>Syrens quiring to the
fates</i>, is explained or rather delivered.</p>

<p>IV. We have seen a <i>Mark</i> of Imitation, in
the allusion of writers to certain strange, and
foreign tenets of philosophy. The observation
may be extended to all those passages (which
are innumerable in our poets) that allude to
the <i>rites, customs, language, and theology of
Paganism</i>.</p>

<p>It is true, indeed, this Species of Imitation
is not that which is, properly, the subject of
this Letter. The most original writer is allowed
to furnish himself with poetical ideas
from all quarters. And the management of
learned <i>Allusion</i> is to be regarded, perhaps, as
one of the nicest offices of Invention. Yet it
may be useful to see from what sources a great
poet derives his materials; and the rather, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250a">250*</span>
this detection will sometimes account for the
<i>manner</i> in which he disposes of them. However,
I will but detain you with a remark or
two on this class of Imitations.</p>

<p>1. I observe, that even Shakespear himself
abounds in learned Allusions. How he came
by them, is another question; though not so
difficult to be answered, you know, as some
have imagined. They, who are in such astonishment
at the learning of Shakespear, besides
that they certainly carry the notion of his illiteracy
too far, forget that the Pagan imagery
was familiar to all the poets of his time&mdash;that
abundance of this sort of learning was to
be picked up from almost every English book,
he could take into his hands&mdash;that many of
the best writers in Greek and Latin had been
translated into English&mdash;that his conversation
lay among the most learned, that is, the most
paganized poets of his age&mdash;but above all, that,
if he had never looked into books, or conversed
with bookish men, he might have learned
almost all the secrets of paganism (so far, I
mean, as a poet had any use of them) from
the <span class="smcap">Masks</span> of B. Jonson; contrived by that
poet with so pedantical an exactness, that one
is ready to take them for lectures and illustrations
on the ancient learning, rather than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251a">251*</span>
exercises of modern wit. The taste of the age,
much devoted to erudition, and still more, the
taste of the Princes, for whom he writ, gave a
prodigious vogue to these unnatural exhibitions.
And the knowledge of antiquity, requisite to
succeed in them, was, I imagine, the reason
that Shakespear was not over-fond to try his
hand at these elaborate trifles. Once indeed
he <i>did</i>, and with such success as to disgrace
the very best things of this kind we find in
Jonson. The short Mask in the <i>Tempest</i> is
fitted up with a classical exactness. But its
chief merit lies in the beauty of the <i>Shew</i>, and
the richness of the <i>poetry</i>. Shakespear was so
sensible of his Superiority, that he could not
help exulting a little upon it, where he makes
<i>Ferdinand</i> say,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is a most majestic <i>Vision</i>, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmonious charming <i>Lays</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>’Tis true, another Poet, who possessed a
great part of Shakespear’s genius and all Jonson’s
learning, has carried this courtly entertainment
to its last perfection. But the <i>Mask
at Ludlow Castle</i> was, in some measure, owing
to the <i>fairy Scenes</i> of his Predecessor; who
chose this province of <i>Tradition</i>, not only as
most suitable to the wildness of his vast creative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252a">252*</span>
imagination, but as the <i>safest</i> for his unlettered
Muse to walk in. For here he had much, you
knew, to expect from the popular credulity,
and nothing to fear from the classic superstition
of that time.</p>

<p>2. It were endless to apply this <i>note</i> of
imitation to other poets confessedly learned.
Yet one instance is curious enough to be just
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Waller, in his famous poem on the
victory over the Dutch on June 3, 1665, has
the following lines;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His flight tow’rds heav’n th’ aspiring <span class="smcap">Belgian</span> took;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fell, like <span class="smcap">Phaeton</span>, with thunder strook:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From vaster hopes than his, he seem’d to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That durst attempt the <span class="smcap">British</span> Admiral:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her broadsides a ruder flame is thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than from the fiery chariot of the Sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">That</span>, bears <small>THE RADIANT ENSIGN OF THE DAY</small>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <span class="smcap">She</span>, the flag that governs in the Sea.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He is comparing the British Admiral’s <i>Ship</i> to
the <i>Chariot</i> of the Sun. You smile at the
quaintness of the conceit, and the ridicule he
falls into, in explaining it. But that is not
the question at present. The <i>latter</i>, he says,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253a">253*</span>
bears <i>the radiant ensign of the day</i>: The
<i>other</i>, <i>the ensign of naval dominion</i>. We
understand how properly the <i>English Flag</i> is
here denominated. But what is that <i>other
Ensign</i>? The <i>Sun</i> itself, it will be said.
But who, in our days, ever expressed the Sun
by such a periphrasis? The image is apparently
antique, and easily explained by those
who know that anciently the Sun was commonly
emblematized by a <i>starry or radiate
figure</i>; nay, that such a figure was placed
aloft, as an <i>Ensign</i>, over the <i>Sun’s charioteer</i>,
as we may see in representations of this sort on
ancient Gems and Medals.</p>

<p>From this original then Mr. Waller’s imagery
was certainly taken; and it is properly
applied in this place where he is speaking
of the <i>Chariot of the Sun</i>, and <i>Phaeton’s
fall</i> from it. But to remove all doubt in the
case, we can even point to the very passage of
a Pagan poet, which Mr. Waller had in his
eye, or rather translated.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proptere&agrave; noctes hiberno tempore long&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cessant, dum veniat <small>RADIATUM INSIGNE DIEI</small>.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Lucr.</i> l. v. 698.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here, you see, the poet’s allusion to a classic
idea has led us to the discovery of the very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254a">254*</span>
passage from which it was taken. And this
use a learned reader will often make of the
species of Imitation, here considered.</p>

<p>V. Great writers, you find, sometimes forget
the character of the <i>Age</i>, they live in; the
<i>principles</i>, and <i>notions</i> that belong to it.
“Sometimes they forget <i>themselves</i>, that is,
their own situation and character.” Another
sign of the influence of <i>Imitation</i>.</p>

<p>1. When we see such men, as <span class="smcap">Strada</span> and
<span class="smcap">Mariana</span>, writers of fine talents indeed, but
of recluse lives and narrow observation, chusing
to talk like men of the world, and abounding
in the most refined conclusions of the cabinet,
we are sure that this character, which we find
so natural in a Cardinal <span class="smcap">de Retz</span>, is but assumed
by these Jesuits. And we are not surprized
to discover, on examination, that their
best reflexions are copied from <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when a man of the
world took it into his head, the other day, in
a moping fit, to talk <i>Sentences</i>, every body
concluded that this was not the language of
the writer or his situation, but that he had been
poaching in some pedant; perhaps in the <i>Stoical
Fop</i>, he affected so much contempt of, <span class="smcap">Seneca</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255a">255*</span></p>

<p>2. Sometimes we catch a great writer deviating
from his <i>natural manner</i>, and taking
pains, as it were, to appear the very reverse of
his proper <i>character</i>. Would you wish a
stronger proof of his being seduced, at least
for the time, by the charms of <i>imitation</i>?</p>

<p>Nothing is better known than the easy, elegant,
agreeable vein of <span class="smcap">Voiture</span>. Yet you
have read his famous Letter to <span class="smcap">Balzac</span>, and
have been surprized, no doubt, at the forced,
quaint, and puffy manner, in which it is
written. The secret is, Voiture is aping Balzac
from one end of this letter to the other.
Whether to pay his court to him, or to laugh
at him, or that perhaps, in the instant of
writing, he really fancied an excellence in the
style of that great man, is not easy to determine.
An eminent French critic, I remember,
is inclined to take it for a piece of mockery.
At all events, we must needs esteem it an
<i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>3. This remark on the turn of a writer’s
<i>genius</i> may be further applied to that of his
<i>temper or disposition</i>.</p>

<p>The natural misanthropy of Swift may account
for his thinking and speaking very often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256a">256*</span>
in the spirit of <span class="smcap">Rochefoucault</span>, without any
thought of taking from his <i>Maxims</i>, though
he was an admirer of them. But if at any
time we observe so humane and benevolent a
man as Mr. Pope giving into this language,
we say of course, “This is not his own, but an
assumed manner.”</p>

<p>Or what say you to an instance that exemplifies
both these observations together? The
natural unaffected turn of Mr. Cowley’s manner,
and the tender sensibility of his mind,
are equally seen and loved in his prose-works,
and in such of his poems as were written after
a good model, or came from the heart. A
clear sparkling fancy, softened with a shade of
melancholy, made him, perhaps, of all our
poets the most capable of excelling in the elegiac
way, or of touching us in any way where
a vein of easy language and moral sentiment is
required. Who but laments then to see this fine
genius perverted by the prevailing pedantry of
his age, and carried away, against the bias of
his nature, to an emulation of the rapturous,
high-spirited Pindar?</p>

<p>I might give many more examples. But
you will observe them in your own reading.
I take the first that come to hand only to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
explain my meaning, which is, “That if you
find a course of sentiments or cast of composition
different from that, to which the writer’s
<i>situation</i>, <i>genius</i>, or <i>complexion</i> would naturally
lead him, you may well suspect him of imitation.”</p>

<p>Still it may be, these considerations are rather
too general. I come to others more particular
and decisive.</p>

<p>VI. It may be difficult sometimes to determine
whether a single sentiment or image be
derived or not. But when we see a cluster of
them in two writers, applied to the same subject,
one can hardly doubt that one of them
has copied from the other.</p>

<p>A celebrated French moralist makes the
following reflexions. “Quelle chimere est-ce
donc que l’homme? Quelle nouveaut&egrave;,
quel chaos, quel sujet de contradiction?
Juge de toutes choses, imbecile ver de terre;
depositaire du vrai, amas d’incertitude; gloire,
et rebut de l’univers.”</p>

<p>Turn now to the <i>Essay on Man</i>, and tell
me if Mr. Pope did not work up the following
lines out of these reflexions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Chaos of thought and passion, all confus’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still by himself abus’d or disabus’d;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Created half to rise, and half to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl’d:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. This conclusion is still more certain,
when, together with a general likeness of sentiments,
we find the same <i>disposition</i> of the
parts, especially if that disposition be in no
common form.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When first on this delightful land he spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flow’r,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Glist’ring with dew”&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the rest of that fine speech in the IVth
Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which you remember
so perfectly that I need not transcribe more
of it.</p>

<p>Milton’s fancy, as usual, is rich and exuberant;
but the conduct and application of his
imagery shews, that the whole passage was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
shadowed out of those charming but simpler
lines in the <span class="smcap">Danae</span> of Euripides.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">——φίλον μὲν φέγγος ἡλίου τόδε.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Καλὸν δὲ πόντου χεῦμ’ ἰδεῖν εὐήνεμον,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Γῆ τ’ ἠρινὸν θάλλουσα, πλούσιόν θ’ ὕδωρ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Πολλῶν τ’ ἔπαινόν ἐστί μοι λέξαι καλῶν.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν οὕτω λαμπρὸν, οὐδ’ ἰδεῖν, καλὸν,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ὡς τοῖς ἄπαισι, καὶ πόθῳ δεδηγμένοις,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Παίδων νεογνῶν ἐν δόμοις ἰδεῖν φάος.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>VII. There is little doubt in such cases as
these. There needs not perhaps be much in
the case, sometimes, of <i>single</i> sentiments or
images. As where we find “a sentiment or
image in two writers precisely the same, yet
new and unusual.”</p>

<p>1. Thus we are told very reasonably, that
<i>Milton’s clust’ring locks</i> is the copy of Apollonius’
ΠΛΟΚΑΜΟΙ ΒΟΤΡΥΟΕΝΤΕΣ. <i>Obs.
on Spenser</i>, p. 80. For though the metaphor
be a just one and very natural, yet there is
perhaps no other authority for the use of it,
but in these two poets. And Milton had certainly
read Apollonius.</p>

<p>2. What the same critic observes of Milton’s</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;“And <i>curl</i> the grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ringlets <i>quaint</i>”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span></p>

<p>being taken from Jonson’s</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When was old Sherwood’s head more <i>quaintly curl’d</i>?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is still more unquestionable. For here is a
combination of signs to convict the former of
imitation: Not only the <i>singularity of the
image</i>, but the <i>identity of expression</i>, and,
what I lay the most stress upon, the <i>boldness
of the figure</i>, as employed by Milton. Jonson
speaks of old Sherwood’s <i>head</i>, as curl’d.
Milton, as conscious of his authority, drops
the preparatory idea, and says at once, The
<i>grove</i> curl’d.</p>

<p>Let me add to these, two more instances
from the same poet.</p>

<p>3. <i>Spenser</i> tells us of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little <i>glooming light</i>, much like a shade.<br /></span>
<span class="author">F. Q. c. <small>II.</small>, s. 14.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Can you imagine that Milton did not take his
idea from hence, when he said, in his <i>Penseroso</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;glowing embers thro’ the room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach <i>light</i> to counterfeit a <i>gloom</i>?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p>4. Again, in his description of Paradise,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Flow’rs of all hues, and without thorn the rose.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Every poet of every time is lavish of his
flowers on such occasions. But <i>the rose without
thorn</i> is a rarity. And, though it was
fine to imagine such an one in Paradise, could
only be an Italian refinement. Tasso, you
will think, is the original, when you have read
the following lines;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Senza quei suoi pungenti ispidi dumi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spieg&ograve; le foglie la purpurea Rosa.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>5. Another instance, still more remarkable,
may be taken from Mr. Pope. One of the
most striking passages in the <i>Essay on Man</i> is
the following,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Superior Beings, when of late they saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal man unfold all nature’s law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admir’d such wisdom in an earthly shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shew’d a <span class="smcap">Newton</span>, as we shew an ape.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Ep. ii. v. 31.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Can you doubt, from the <i>singularity</i> of this
sentiment, that the great poet had his eye on
Plato? who makes Socrates say, in allusion to
a remark of Heraclitus, Ὅτι ἀνθρώπων ὁ σοφώτατος
πρὸς θεὸν πίθηκος φανεῖται. <i>Hipp. Major.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>The application indeed is different. And it
could not be otherwise. For the observation,
which the Philosopher refers πρὸς θεὸν, is in
the Poet given to <i>superior Beings</i> only. The
consequence is, that the <i>Ape</i> is an object of
<i>derision</i> in the former case, of <i>admiration</i>, in
the latter.</p>

<p>To conclude this head, I will just observe to
you, that, though the <i>same uncommon sentiment</i>
in two <i>writers</i> be usually the effect of imitation,
yet we cannot affirm this of <i>Actors</i> in
real life. The reason is, when the situation of
two men is the same, <i>Nature</i> will dictate the
same sentiments more invariably than <i>Genius</i>.
To give a remarkable instance of what I mean.</p>

<p>Tacitus relates, in the <i>first</i> book of his <i>Annals</i>,
what passed in the senate on its first
meeting after the death of Augustus. His
politic successor carried it, for some time, with
much apparent moderation. He wished, besides
other reasons, to get himself solemnly
recognized for Emperor by that Body, before
he entered on the exercise of his new dignity.
<i>Dabat fam&aelig;</i>, says the historian, <i>ut vocatus
electusque poti&ugrave;s &agrave; Republic&acirc; videretur, qu&agrave;m
per uxorium ambitum et senili adoptione irrepsisse</i>.
One of his courtiers would not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
wanting to himself on such an occasion. When
therefore several motions had been made in
the Senate, concerning the honours to be paid
to the memory of their late Prince, <span class="smcap">Valerius
Messalla</span> moved <span class="smcap">Renovandum per annos
sacramentum in nomen Tiberii</span>; in other
words, that the oath of allegiance should be
taken to Tiberius. This was the very point
that Tiberius drove at. And the consciousness
of it made him suspect that this motion might
be thought to proceed from himself. He therefore
asked Messalla, “<i>Num, se mandante, eam
sententiam promsisset?</i>” His answer is in
the following words. “Spont&egrave; <i>dixisse, respondit;
neque in iis, qu&aelig; ad rempublicam
pertinerent</i>, consilio nisi suo usurum, vel
cum periculo offensionis.” <i>Ea</i>, concludes
the historian, <i>sola species adulandi supererat</i>.</p>

<p>Now it is very remarkable, that we find in
Ludlow’s memoirs, one of Cromwell’s officers,
on the very same occasion, answering the Protector
in the very same species of flattery.</p>

<p>Colonel <span class="smcap">William Jephson</span> moved in the
House that Cromwell might be made King.
Cromwell took occasion, soon after, to reprove
the Colonel for this proposition, telling him, that
he wondered what he could mean by it. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
which the other replied, “<i>That while he was
permitted the honour of sitting in that House,
he must desire the liberty to discharge his
conscience, though his opinion should happen
to displease</i>.”</p>

<p>Here we have a very striking coincidence of
<i>sentiment</i>, without the least probability of
imitation. For no body, I dare say, suspects
Colonel William Jephson of stealing this refined
stroke of adulation from Valerius Messalla.
The truth is, the same situation, concurring
with the same corrupt disposition,
dictated this peculiar sentiment to the two
courtiers. Yet, had these similar thoughts
been found in two dramatic poets of the Augustan
and Oliverian ages, we should probably
have cried out, “An Imitation.” And with
good reason. For, besides the possibility of
an Oliverian poet’s knowing something of Tacitus,
the speakers had then been <i>feigned</i>, not
real personages. And it is not so likely that
two such should agree in this sentiment: I
mean, considering how new and particular it
is. For, as to the more common and obvious
sentiments, even dramatic speakers will very
frequently employ the <i>same</i>, without affording
any just reason to conclude that their prompters
had turned plagiaries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>VIII. If to this singularity of a sentiment,
you add the <i>apparent harshness</i> of it, especially
when not gradually <i>prepared</i> (as such
sentiments always will be by exact writers,
when of their own proper invention), the suspicion
grows still stronger. I just glanced at
an instance of this sort in Milton’s <i>curl’d</i> grove.
But there are others still more remarkable.
Shall I presume for once to take an instance
from yourself?</p>

<p>Your fine Ode to Memory begins with these
very lyrical verses:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother of Wisdom! Thou whose sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throng’d ideal hosts obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bidst their ranks now vanish, now appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flame in the van, and darken in the rear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This sublime imagery has a very original
air. Yet I, who know how familiar the best
ancient and modern critics are to you, have no
doubt that it is taken from <span class="smcap">Strada</span>.</p>

<p>“Quid accommodatius, says he, speaking
of your subject, Memory, qu&agrave;m <i>simulachrorum
ingentes copias</i>, tanqu&agrave;m <i>addictam ubique tibi
sacramento militiam</i>, eo inter se nexu ac fide
conjunctam coh&aelig;rentemque habere; ut sive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
unumquodque separatim, sive confertim universa,
sive singula ordinatim <i>in aciem proferre</i>
velis; nihil plan&egrave; in tant&acirc; rerum herb&acirc; turbetur,
sed alia <i>procul atque in recessu</i> sita prodeuntibus
locum cedant; alia, se tota confestim
promant atque in medium <i>cert&ograve; evocata prosiliant</i>?
Hoc tam magno, tam fido domesticorum
<i>agmine</i> instructus animus, &amp;c.”
<span class="author">
<i>Prol. Acad.</i> I.</span></p>

<p>Common writers know little of the art of
<i>preparing</i> their ideas, or believe the very
name of an Ode absolves them from the care
of art. But, if this uncommon sentiment
had been intirely your own, you, I imagine,
would have dropped some <i>leading</i> idea to
introduce it.</p>

<p>IX. You see with what a suspicious eye, we
who aspire to the name of critics, examine your
writings. But every poet will not endure to
be scrutinized so narrowly.</p>

<p>1. B. Jonson, in his Prologue to the <i>Sad
Shepherd</i>, is opening the subject of that poem.
The <i>sadness</i> of his shepherd is</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For his lost Love, who in the <span class="smcap">Trent</span> is said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have miscarried; <i>’las! what knows the head</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of a calm river, whom the feet have drown’d!</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<p>The reflexion in this place is unnecessary
and even impertinent. Who besides ever
heard of the <i>feet</i> of a river? Of <i>arms</i>, we have.
And so it stood in Jonson’s original.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Greatest and fairest Empress, know you this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! no more than Thames’ calm head doth know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose meads his arms drown, or whose corn o’erflow.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Dr. <span class="smcap">Donne</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poet is speaking of the corruption of
the courts of justice, and the allusion is perfectly
fine and natural. Jonson was tempted
to bring it into his prologue by the mere
beauty of the sentiment. He had a river at
his disposal, and would not let slip the opportunity.
But “his unnatural use” of it detects
his “imitation.”</p>

<p>2. I don’t know whether you have taken
notice of a miscarriage, something like this,
in the most judicious of all the poets.</p>

<p>Theocritus makes Polypheme say,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Καὶ γὰρ θὴν οὐδ’ εἶδος ἔχω κακὸν, ὥς με λέγοντι,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ἦ γὰρ πρὰν ἐς Πόντον ἐσέβλεπον· ἦν δὲ γαλάνα.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>Nothing could be better fancied than to
make this enormous son of Neptune use the
sea for his looking-glass. But is Virgil so
happy when his little land-man says,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nec sum ade&ograve; informis: nuper me in littore vidi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&ugrave;m placidum ventis staret <i>mare</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>His wonderful judgment for once deserted
him, or he might have retained the sentiment
with a slight change in the application. For
instance, what if he had said,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cert&egrave; ego me novi, liquid&aelig;que in imagine vidi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nuper aqu&aelig;, placuitque mihi mea forma videnti.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a sort of curiosity, you say, to find
Ovid reading a lesson to Virgil. I will dissemble
nothing. The lines are, as I have
cited them, in the 13th book of the Metamorphosis.
But unluckily they are put into the
mouth of Polypheme. So that instead of instructing
one poet by the other, I only propose
that they should make an exchange; Ovid
take Virgil’s <i>sea</i>, and Virgil be contented with
Ovid’s <i>water</i>. However this be, you may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
sure the authority of the Prince of the Latin
poets will carry it with admiring posterity
above all such scruples of decorum. Nobody
wonders therefore to read in Tasso,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Non son’ io<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Da disprezzar, se ben me stesso vidi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nel liquido del mar, quando l’altr’ hieri<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taceano i venti, et ei giacea senz’ onda.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But of all the misappliers of this fine original
sentiment, commend me to that <i>other</i> Italian,
who made his shepherd survey himself, in
a <i>fountain</i> indeed, but a fountain of his own
weeping.</p>

<p>3. You will forgive my adding one other
instance “of this vicious application of a fine
thought.”</p>

<p>You remember those agreeable verses of Sir
<i>John Suckling</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tempests of winds thus (as my storms of grief<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Carry my tears which should relieve my heart)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have hurried to the thankless ocean clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And show’rs, that needed not at all the courtesy.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
<span class="i1">When the poor plains have languish’d for the want,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And almost burnt asunder.”&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Brennoralt.</i> A. <small>III.</small> S. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I don’t stay to examine how far the fancy of
<i>tears relieving the heart</i> is allowable. But
admitting the propriety of the observation, in
the sense the poet intended it, the simile is
applied and expressed with the utmost beauty.
It accordingly struck the best writers of that
time. <span class="smcap">Sprat</span>, in his history of the <i>Royal Society</i>,
is taking notice of the misapplication of
philosophy to subjects of Religion. “That
shower, says he, has done very much injury
by falling on the sea, for which the shepherd,
and the ploughman, called in vain:
The wit of men has been profusely poured
out on <i>Religion</i>, which needed not its help,
and which was only thereby made more
tempestuous: while it might have been more
fruitfully spent, on some parts of <i>philosophy</i>,
which have been hitherto barren, and might
soon have been made fertile.” <i>p. 25.</i></p>

<p>You see what wire-drawing here is to make
the comparison, so proper in its original use,
just and pertinent to a subject to which it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
naturally no relation. Besides, there is an
absurdity in speaking of a shower’s doing <i>injury</i>
to the sea by falling into it. But the thing
illustrated by this comparison requiring the
idea of <i>injury</i>, he transfers the idea to the
comparing thing. He would soften the absurdity,
by running the comparison into metaphorical
expression, but, I think, it does not
remove it. In short, for these reasons, one
might easily have inferred an Imitation, without
that parenthesis to apologize for it&mdash;“To
use that metaphor which an excellent poet of
our nation turns to <i>another</i> purpose&mdash;”</p>

<p>But a poet of that time has no better success
in the management of this metaphor, than the
Historian.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Love</span> makes so many hearts the prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the bright <span class="smcap">Carlisle’s</span> conqu’ring eyes;<br /></span>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Waller’s</span> Poems, p. 25.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Sentiment stands thus: “She regards
the captive <i>hearts</i> of others no more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
those others&mdash;the <i>tears</i> of lesser beauties.”
Thus, with much difficulty, we get to <i>tears</i>.
And when we have them, the allusion to <i>lost
clouds</i> is so strained (besides that he makes
his shower both <i>useless</i> and <i>injurious</i>), that
one readily perceives the poet’s thought was
distorted by <i>imitation</i>.</p>

<p>X. The charge of Plagiarism is so disreputable
to a great writer that one is not surprized
to find him anxious to avoid the imputation
of it. Yet “this very anxiety serves,
sometimes, to fix it upon him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dryden, in the Preface to his translation
of Fresnoy’s Art of Painting, makes the
following observation on Virgil: “He pretends
sometimes to trip, but ’tis only to make you
think him in danger of a fall when he is
most secure. Like a skilful dancer on the
Rope (if you will pardon the meanness of
the similitude) who slips willingly and makes
a seeming stumble, that you may think him
in great hazard of breaking his neck; while
at the same time he is only giving you a
proof of his dexterity. My late Lord Roscommon
was often pleased with this reflexion,
&amp;c.” p. 50.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>His apology for the use of this simile, and
his concluding with Lord Roscommon’s satisfaction
at his remark, betray, I think, an
anxiety to pass for original, under the consciousness
of being but an imitator. So that
if we were to meet with a passage, very like
this, in a celebrated ancient, we could hardly
doubt of its being copied by Mr. Dryden.
What think you then of this observation in
one of Pliny’s Letters, “Ut quasdam artes,
it&agrave; eloquentiam nihil magis qu&agrave;m ancipitia
commendant. Vides qui fune in summa
nituntur, quantos soleant excitare clamores,
c&ugrave;m jam jamque casuri videntur.” L. ix.
Ep. 26.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prior</span>, one may observe, has acted more
naturally in his <i>Alma</i>, and by so doing, though
the resemblance be full as great, one is not so
certain of his being an Imitator. The verses
are, of <span class="smcap">Butler</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He perfect Dancer climbs the Rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And balances your fear and hope:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Strait gath’ring all his active strength<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And owe your pleasure to your <i>fright</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">C. <small>II.</small><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though the two last lines seem taken from
the application of this similitude in Pliny,
“Sunt enim maxim&egrave; <i>mirabilia</i>, qu&aelig; maxim&egrave;
inexpectata, et maxim&egrave; <i>periculosa</i>.”</p>

<p>XI. Writers are, sometimes, sollicitous to
conceal themselves: At others, they are fond
to proclaim their Imitation. “It is when
they have a mind to shew their dexterity in
contending with a great original.”</p>

<p>You remember these lines of Milton in his
Comus,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">Wisdom’s self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft seeks to sweet retired Solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the various bustle of resort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impair’d.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On which Dr. Warburton has the following
note. “Mr. Pope has imitated this thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
and (as was always his way when he imitated)
improved it.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Bear me, some Gods! oh, quickly bear me hence<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To wholesome Solitude, the nurse of Sense;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where Contemplation prunes her ruffled wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the free Soul looks down to pity Kings.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Mr. Pope has not only improved the harmony,
but the sense. In Milton, <i>Contemplation</i>
is called the <i>Nurse</i>; in Pope, more
properly <i>Solitude</i>: In Milton, <i>Wisdom</i> is
said to <i>prune</i> her wings; in Pope, <i>Contemplation</i>
is said to do it, and with much greater
propriety, as she is of a <i>soaring</i> nature, and
on that account is called by Milton himself,
the <i>Cherub Contemplation</i>.”</p>

<p>One sees that Mr. Pope’s view was to surpass
his original; “which, it is said, was always his
way when he imitated.” The meaning is,
when he purposely and professedly bent himself
to Imitation; for then his fine genius
taught him to seize every beauty, and his
wonderful judgment, to avoid every defect or
impropriety, in his author. And this distinction
is very material to our passing a right
judgment on the merit of Imitation. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
commonly said, that their imitations fall short
of their originals. And they will do so, whatever
the Genius of the Imitator be, if they are
formed only on a <i>general</i> resemblance of the
thought imitated. For an Inventor comprehends
his own ideas more distinctly and fully,
and of course expresses his purpose better,
than a casual Imitator. But the case is different,
when a good writer <i>studies</i> the passage
from which he borrows. For then he not only
copies, but improves on the first idea; and
thus there will frequently (as in the case of
Pope) be greater merit in the Copyist, than the
original.</p>

<p>XII. We sometimes catch an Imitation
lurking “in a licentious Paraphrase.” The
ground of suspicion lies in the very complacency
with which a writer expatiates on a borrowed
sentiment. He is usually more reserved
in adorning one of his own.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Aurelius Victor</span> observes of Fabricius,

<p>2. The ingenious author of the <i>Observations
on Spenser</i> (from which fine specimen of his
critical talents one is led to expect great
things) directs us to another imitation of this
sort.</p>

<p>Tasso had said,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cosi a le belle lagrime le piume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si bagna Amore, e gode al chiaro lume.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On which short hint Spenser has raised the
following luxuriant imagery,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The blinded archer-boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like lark in show’r of rain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under those crystal drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which fall from her fair eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at their brightest beams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Him proyn’d in lovely wise.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. I will just add two more examples of the
same kind; chiefly, because they illustrate an
observation, very proper to be attended to on
this subject; which is, “That in this display
of a borrowed thought, the Imitation will
generally fall short of the Original, even
though the borrower be the greater Genius.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>The Italian poet, just now quoted, says
sublimely of the <i>Night</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;Usci la Notte, &egrave; sotto l’ali<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men&ograve; il silentio&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author">C. v. S. 79.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Milton has given a paraphrase of this passage,
but very much below his original,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now came still ev’ning on, and twilight gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had in her sober livery all things clad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Silence accompany’d</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The striking part of Tasso’s picture, is,
“<i>Night’s bringing in Silence under her
wings</i>.” So new and singular an idea as this
had detected an Imitation. Milton contents
himself, then, with saying simply, <i>Silence
accompany’d</i>. However, to make amends, as
he thought, for this defect, <i>Night itself</i>,
which the Italian had merely personized, the
English poet not only <i>personizes</i>, but employs
in a very becoming office:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now came still ev’ning on, and twilight gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had in her sober livery all things clad.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Every body will observe a little blemish, in
this fine couplet. He should not have used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the epithet <i>still</i>, when he intended to add,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Silence</i> accompanied&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But there is a worse fault in this <i>Imitation</i>.
To hide it, he speaks of <i>Night’s livery</i>. When
he had done that, to speak of her <i>wings</i>, had
been ungraceful. Therefore he is forced to
say obscurely as well as <i>simply</i>, <i>Silence accompany’d</i>:
And so loses a more noble image for
a less noble one. The truth is, they would
not stand together. <i>Livery</i> belongs to <i>human
grandeur; wings</i> to <i>divine</i> or <i>celestial</i>. So
that in Milton’s very attempt to surpass his
original, he put it out of his power to employ
the <i>circumstance</i> that most recommended it.</p>

<p>He is not happier on another occasion.
Spenser had said with his usual simplicity,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Virtue gives herself light thro’ darkness for to wade,”<br /></span>
<span class="author">F. Q. B. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Milton catched at this image, and has run it
into a sort of paraphrase, in those fine lines,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Virtue could see to do what virtue would<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By her own radiant light, tho’ Sun and Moon<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were in the flat sea sunk&mdash;”<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Comus.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>In Spenser’s line we have the idea of Virtue
dropt down into a world, all over darkened
with vice and error. Virtue excites the light
of truth to see all around her, and not only
dissipate the neighbouring darkness, but to
direct her course in pursuing her victory and
driving her enemy out of it; the arduousness
of which exploit is well expressed by&mdash;<i>thro’
darkness for to</i> <small>WADE</small>. On the contrary, Milton,
in borrowing, substitutes the physical for
the moral idea&mdash;<i>by her own radiant light</i>&mdash;and
<i>tho’ Sun and Moon were in the flat sea
sunk</i>. It may be asked, how this happened?
Very naturally, Milton was caught with the
obvious <i>imagery</i>, which he found he could
display to more advantage; and so did not
enough attend to the noble <i>sentiment</i> that was
couched under it.</p>

<p>XIII. These are instances of a paraphrastical
licence in dilating on a famous Sentiment or
Image. The <i>ground</i> is the same, only flourished
upon by the genius of the Imitator. At
times we find him practising a different art;
“not merely spreading, as it were, and laying
open the same sentiment, but <i>adding</i> to it,
and by a new and studied device improving
upon it.” In this case we naturally conclude
that the refinement had not been made, if the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
plain and simple thought had not preceded and
given rise to it. You will apprehend my
meaning by what follows.</p>

<p>1. Shakespear had said of Henry IV<sup>th</sup>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;He cannot long hold out these pangs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The incessant care and labour of his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wrought the mure, that should confine it in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thin, that life look through, and will break out.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">Hen. IV.</span> A. 4.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>You have, here, the thought in its first simplicity.
It was not unnatural, after speaking
of the body, as a case or tenement of the Soul,
<i>the mure that confines</i> it, to say, that as that
case wears away and grows thin, life looks
through, and is ready to break out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>, by refining on this sentiment, if by
nothing else, shews himself to be the copyist.
Speaking of the same Henry, he observes,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Pain and Grief, inforcing more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Besieg’d the hold that could not long defend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consuming so all the resisting store<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of those provisions Nature deign’d to lend,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
<span class="i0">As that the Walls, worn thin, permit the mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look out thorough, and his frailty find.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we see, not simply that <i>Life</i> is going
to break through the infirm and much-worn
habitation, but that the <i>Mind</i> looks through
and <i>finds</i> his frailty, that it discovers, that
Life will soon make his escape. I might add,
that the four first lines are of the nature of the
<i>Paraphrase</i>, considered in the last article:
And that the <i>expression</i> of the others is too
much the same to be original. But we are
not yet come to the head of <i>expression</i>. And
I choose to confine myself to the single point
of view we have before us.</p>

<p>Daniel’s improvement, then, looks like the
artifice of a man that would outdo his Master.
Though he fails in the attempt: for his ingenuity
betrays him into a false thought. The
mind, looking through, does not find <i>its own
frailty</i>, but the frailty of the <i>building</i> it inhabits.
However, I have endeavoured to rectify
this mistake in my explanation.</p>

<p>The truth is, Daniel was not a man to improve
upon Shakespear. But now comes a
writer, that knew his business much better.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
He chuses to employ this well-worn image, or
rather to alter it a little and then employ it,
for the conveyance of a very new fancy. If
the mind could look through a <i>thin</i> body,
much more one that was <i>cracked</i> and battered.
And if it be for looking through at all, he will
have it look to good purpose, and find, not its
frailty only, but much other useful knowledge.</p>

<p>The lines are Mr. Waller’s, and in the best
manner of that very <i>refined</i> writer.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stronger by weakness, <i>wiser</i>, men become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they draw near to their eternal home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Soul’s dark cottage, batter’d and decay’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lets in new light thro’ chinks that time has made.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. After all, these conceits, I doubt, are
not much to your taste. The instance I am
going to give, will afford you more pleasure.
Is there a passage in Milton you read with more
admiration, than this in the <i>Penseroso</i>?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Entice the dewy-feather’d sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let some strange mysterious dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wave at his wings in airy stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lively portraiture display’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softly on my eye-lids laid.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>Would you think it possible now that the
ground-work of this fine imagery should be
laid in a passage of Ben Jonson? Yet so we
read, or seem to read, in his <i>Vision of Delight</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Break, Phant’sy, from thy cave of cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread thy purple wings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Create of airy forms a stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tho’ it be a waking dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet let it like an odour rise<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To all the senses here,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fall like sleep upon their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or musick in their ear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a delicate matter to analyze such passages
as these; which, how exquisite soever
in the poetry, when estimated by the <i>fine
phrenzy</i> of a Genius, hardly look like sense
when given in plain prose. But if you give
me leave to take them in pieces, I will do it,
at least, with reverence. We find then, that
<i>Fancy</i> is here employed in one of her nicest
operations, the production of a <i>day-dream</i>;
which both poets represent as an <i>airy form</i>,
or forms <i>streaming</i> in the air, gently falling
on the eye-lids of her entranced votary. So
far their imagery agrees. But now comes the
<i>mark</i> of imitation I would point out to you.
Milton carries the idea still further, and improves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
finely upon it, in the <i>conception</i> as well as
expression. Jonson evokes fancy out of her
<i>cave of cloud</i>, those cells of the mind, as it
were, in which during her intervals of rest, and
when unemploy’d, fancy lies hid; and bids
her, like a Magician, <i>create</i> this stream of
forms. All this is just and truly poetical. But
Milton goes further. He employs the <i>dewy-feather’d
sleep</i> as his Minister in this machinery.
And the mysterious day-dream is seen
<i>waving at his wings in airy stream</i>. Jonson
would have Fancy <i>immediately</i> produce this
Dream. Milton more poetically, because in
more distinct and particular imagery, represents
Fancy as doing her work by means of
<i>sleep</i>; that soft composure of the mind abstracted
from outward objects, in which it
yields to these phantastic impressions.</p>

<p>You see then a wonderful improvement in
this addition to the original thought. And the
notion of <i>dreams waving at the wings of sleep</i>
is, by the way, further justified by what Virgil
feigns of their <i>sticking</i> or rather fluttering
on the leaves of his magic tree in the infernal
regions. But it is curious to observe how this
improvement itself arose from hints suggested
by his original. From Jonson’s dream, <i>falling,
like sleep upon their eyes</i>, Milton took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
his <i>feather’d sleep</i>, which he impersonates so
properly; And from <i>Phant’sy’s spreading her
purple wings</i>, a circumstance, not so immediately
connected with Jonson’s design <i>of
creating of airy forms a stream</i>, he catched
the idea of <i>Sleep spreading her wings</i>; and to
good purpose, since the airy stream of forms
was to <i>wave at them</i>.</p>

<p>However, Jonson’s image is, in itself, incomparable.
It is taken from a <i>winged</i> insect
breaking out of its Aurelia state, its <i>cave of
cloud</i>, as it is finely called: Not unlike that of
Mr. Pope,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So spins the Silk-worm small its slender store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labours till it <i>clouds</i> itself all o’er.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><small>IV.</small> <i>Dunc.</i> v. 253.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And nothing can be juster than this allusion.
For the ancients always pictured <span class="smcap">Fancy</span> and
<span class="smcap">Human-love</span> with Insect’s wings.</p>

<p>XIV. Thus then, whether the poet <i>prevaricates</i>,
<i>enlarges</i>, or <i>adds</i>, still we frequently
find some latent circumstance, attending his
management, that convicts him of Imitation.
Nay, he is not safe even when he denies himself
these liberties; I mean when he only
<i>glances</i> at his original. “For, in this case,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
the borrowed sentiment usually wants something
of that perspicuity which always attends
the first delivery of it.” This Rule
may be considered as the Reverse of the <i>last</i>.
A writer, sometimes, takes a pleasure to <i>refine</i>
on a plain thought: Sometimes (and that is
usually when the original sentiment is well
known and fully developed) he does not so
much as attempt to open and <i>explain</i> it.</p>

<p>A poet of the last age has the following lines,
on the subject of <i>Religion</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Religion now is a young Mistress here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which each man will fight, and dye at least;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let it alone awhile, and ’t will become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of married wife; people will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content to live with it in quietness.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Suckling</span> says this in his Tragedy of Brennoralt;
which is a Satire throughout on the
rising troubles of that time. <span class="smcap">Butler</span> has
taken the thought and applied it on the same
occasion:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When hard words, jealousies, and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set folks together by the ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make them fight, like mad or drunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dame Religion, as for Punk.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>Setting aside the difference between the
burlesque and serious style, one easily sees
that this sentiment is borrowed from Suckling.
It has not the clear and full exposition of an
original thought. Butler only represents men
as drunk with Religion and fighting for it as
for a Punk. The <i>other</i> gives the reason of the
Debauch, namely, <i>fondness for a new face</i>;
and tells us, besides, how things would subside
into peace or indifference on a nearer and
more familiar acquaintance. One could expect
no less from the <i>Inventor</i> of this humorous
thought; a <i>Borrower</i> might be content
to allude to it.</p>

<p>XV. This last consideration puts me in
mind of another artifice to conceal a borrowed
sentiment. Nothing lies more open to discovery
than a Simile in form, especially if it be
a remarkable one. These are a sort of <i>purpurei
panni</i> which catch all eyes; and, if the
comparison be not a writer’s own, he is almost
sure to be detected. The way then that refined
Imitators take to conceal themselves, in
such a case, is to run the Similitude into Allegory.
We have a curious instance in Mr.
Pope, who has succeeded so well in the
attempt, that his plagiarism, I believe, has
never been suspected.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p>The verses, I have in my eye, are these fine
ones, addressed to Lord Bolingbroke,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, while along the stream of time thy name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expanded flies, and gathers all it’s fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, shall my little Bark attendant sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursue the triumph, and partake the Gale?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>What think you, now, of these admired
verses? Are they, besides their other beauties,
perfectly original? You will be able to resolve
this question, by turning to the following passage
in a Poet, Mr. Pope was once fond of, I
mean <span class="smcap">Statius</span>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>XVI. I release you from this head of <i>Sentiments</i>,
with observing that we sometimes
conclude a writer to have had a celebrated original
in his eye, when “without copying the
peculiar thought, or stroke of imagery, he
gives us only a copy of the impression, it
had made upon him.”</p>

<p>1. In delivering this rule, I will not dissemble
that I myself am copying, or rather
stealing from a great critic: From <i>one</i>, however,
who will not resent this theft; as indeed
he has no reason, for he is so prodigiously rich
in these things, as in others of more value,
that what he neglects or flings away, would
make the fortune of an ordinary writer. The
person I mean is the late Editor of Shakespear,
who, in an admirable note on Julius C&aelig;sar,
taking occasion to quote that passage of Cato,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O think what anxious moments pass between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birth of plots, and their last fatal periods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, ’tis a dreadful interval of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill’d up with horror all, and big with death,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>observes “that Mr. Addison was so struck and
affected with the <i>terrible graces</i> of Shakespear
(in the passage he is there considering)
that, instead of imitating his author’s sentiments,
he hath, before he was aware, given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
us only the copy of his own impressions
made by them. For,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, ’tis a dreadful interval of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill’d up with horror all, and big with death,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>are but the affections raised by such forcible
images as these,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;All the Int’rim is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a Phantasma, or a hideous dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;The state of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a little kingdom, suffers then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nature of an Insurrection.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The observation is new and finely applied.
Give me leave to suppose that the following is
an instance of the same nature.</p>

<p>2. Milton on a certain occasion says of
<i>Death</i>, that she</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Grinn’d horrible a ghastly smile&mdash;”<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>P. L.</i> B. II. v. 846.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This representation is supposed by his
learned Editor to be taken from Homer, from
Statius, or from the Italian poets. A certain
friend of ours, not to be named without honour,
and therefore not at all on so slight an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
occasion, suggests that it might probably be
copied from Spenser’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grinning griesly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author">B. V. c. 12.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And there is the more likelihood in this conjecture,
as the poet a little before had call’d
<i>death&mdash;the griesly terror</i>&mdash;v. 704. But after
all, if he had any preceding writer in view, I
suspect it might be <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>; who, in his
<i>Wife for a Month</i>, has these remarkable lines,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The game of Death was never play’d more nobly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meagre thief grew <i>wanton</i> in his mischiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>his shrunk hollow eyes smil’d</i> on his ruin.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The word <i>Ghastly</i>, I would observe, gives
the precise idea of <i>shrunk hollow eyes</i>, and
looks as if Milton, in admiration of his original,
had only looked out for an <i>epithet</i> to Death’s
smile, as he found it pictured in Fletcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus much</span>, then, may perhaps serve for
an illustration of the first part of this Inquiry.
We have found out several <i>marks</i>, and applied
them to various passages in the best writers,
from which we may reasonably enough be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
allowed to infer an Imitation in point of <i>Sentiment</i>.
For what respect the other part of
<i>Expression</i>, this is an easier task, and will be
dispatched in few words.</p>

<p>Only you will indulge me in an observation
or two, to prevent your expecting from me
more than I undertake to perform.</p>

<p>When I speak of <i>Expression</i>, then I mean
to confine myself “to single words of sentences,
or at most the structure of a passage.”
When <i>Imitation</i> is carried so far as to affect
the general cast of language, or what we call a
<i>Style</i>, no great sagacity is, perhaps, required
to detect it. Thus the <i>Ciceroniani</i>, if they
were not ambitious of proclaiming themselves,
are discoverable at the first glance. And the
later Roman poets, as well as the modern
Latin versifiers, are, to the best of their power,
<i>Virgilian</i>. The thing is perhaps still easier in
a living language; especially if that language be
our own. Milton and Pope, if they have made
but few poets, have made many imitators; so
many, that we are ready to complain there is
hardly an original poet left.</p>

<p>Another point seems of no importance in
the present inquiry. I know, it is asked, How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
far a writer casually or designedly imitates?
that is, whether he copies another from memory
only, without recollecting, at the time,
the passage from which his expression is drawn,
or purposely, and with full knowledge of his
original. And this consideration is of much
weight, as I have shewn at large, where the
question is concerning the <i>credit</i> of the supposed
imitator. For this is affected by nothing
but direct and <i>intended</i> imitation. But as we
are looking at present only for those marks in
the expression which shew it <i>not</i> to be original,
it is enough that the resemblance is such as
cannot well be accounted for but on the supposition
of some sort of commerce; whether
immediately perceived by the writer himself,
is not material. ’Tis true, this observation is
applicable to <i>sentiments</i> as well as expression;
and I have not pretended to give the preceding
articles, as proofs, or even presumptions, in
all cases, that the later writer copied intentionally
from a former. But there is this difference
in the two cases. <i>Sentiments</i> may be
strikingly similar, or even identical, without
the least thought, or even effect, of a preceding
original. But the identity of <i>expression</i>, except
in some few cases of no importance, is,
in the same language, where the writer speaks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
entirely from himself, an almost impossible
thing. And you will be of this mind, if you
reflect on the infinitely varied lights in which
the same image or sentiment presents itself to
different writers; the infinitely varied purpose
they have to serve by it; or where it happens
to strike precisely in the same manner, and is
directed precisely to the same end, the infinite
combinations of words in which it may be expressed.
To all which you may add, that the least
imaginable variation, either in the terms or the
structure of them, not only destroys the
identity, but often disfigures the resemblance
to that degree that we hardly know it to be a
resemblance.</p>

<p>So that you see, the <i>marks</i> of imitated or,
if you will, <i>derived expression</i> are much less
equivocal, than of <i>sentiment</i>. We may pronounce
of the <i>former</i> without hesitation, that
it is taken, when corresponding marks in the
<i>latter</i> would only authorise us to conclude that
it was the <i>same</i> or perhaps <i>similar</i>.</p>

<p>I need not use more words to convince you,
that the distinction of <i>casual</i> and <i>design’d</i>
imitation is still of less significancy in this class
of imitations, than the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>And with this preamble, more particular
perhaps and circumstantial than was necessary,
I now proceed to lay before you some of those
<i>signs</i> of derived expression, which I conceive
to be <i>unequivocal</i>. If they are so, they will
generally appear at first sight; so that I shall
have little occasion to trouble you, as I did
before, with my comments. It will be sufficient
to deliver the <i>rule</i>, and to <i>exemplify</i> it.</p>

<p>I. An identity of expression, especially if
carried on through an intire sentence, is the
most certain proof of imitation.</p>

<span class="i0">Cloaths the gay spring, the season of desire.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Fenton takes notice that the poet is
copying from the <i>Muiopotmos</i> of Spenser.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the gay gardens his unstaid desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him wholly carried to refresh his sprights:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
<span class="i0"><i>There lavish Nature, in her best attire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pours forth sweet odours and alluring sights.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We shall see presently that, besides the identity
of expression, there is also another mark
of imitation in this passage.</p>

<p>II. But less than this will do, where the
similarity of thought, and application of it, is
striking.</p>

<p>Mr. Pope says divinely well,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shall burning &AElig;tna, if a sage requires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget to thunder and recall its fires?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh blameless Bethel! to relieve thy breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the loose mountain trembles from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall <i>gravitation cease if you go by</i>?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For Chartres’ head reserve the hanging wall?<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Essay</i> <small>IV. V.</small> 123.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now turn to Mr. Wollaston, an easy natural
writer (where his natural manner is not stiffened
by a mathematical pedantry) and abounding
in fine sallies of the imagination; and see if
the poet did not catch his <i>expression</i>, as well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
as the fire of his conception in this place, from
the philosopher:</p>

<p>“As to the course of Nature, if a good man
be passing by an infirm building, just in the
article of falling, can it be expected that God
should <i>suspend the force of gravitation till he
is gone by</i>, in order to his deliverance; or can
we think it would be increased, and the fall
hastened, if a bad man was there, only that
he might be caught, crushed, and made an
example? If a man’s safety or prosperity should
depend upon winds or rains, must <i>new motions
be impressed upon the atmosphere</i>, and new
directions given to the floating parts of it, by
some extraordinary and new influence from
God?”</p>

<p>III. Sometimes the original expression is not
taken but paraphrased; and the writer disguises
himself in a kind of circumlocution.
Yet this artifice does not conceal him, especially
if some fragments, as it were, of the
inventor’s phrase are found dispersedly in the
imitation.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For in the secret of her troubled thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A doubtful combat love and honour fought.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Fairfax’s Tasso</i>, B. <small>IV.</small> S. 70.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>

<p>Hence Mr. Waller,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There public care and private passion <i>fought</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A doubtful combat</i> in his noble <i>thought</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Poems</i>, p. 14.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Public care</i> is the periphrasis of <i>honour</i>, and
<i>private passion</i>, of <i>love</i>. For the rest you see&mdash;<i>disjecti
membra poetæ</i>.</p>

<p>IV. An imitation is discoverable, when there
is but the least particle of the original expression,
“by a peculiar and no very natural arrangement
of words.”</p>

<p>In Fletcher’s <i>faithful Shepherdess</i>, the
speaker says,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; In thy face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines more awful majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than dull weak mortality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare with misty eyes behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">And live</span>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The writer glanced, but very improperly on
such an occasion, at <i>Exod.</i> xxxiii. 20. “Thou
canst not see my face: for there shall no man
see me, <i>and live</i>.”</p>

<p>V. An uncommon <i>construction</i> of words
not identical, especially if the subject be the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
same, or the ideas similar, will look like
imitation.</p>

<p>Milton says finely of the <i>Swan</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;The Swan with arched neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between her white wings mantling proudly <small>ROWS</small><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Her state</span>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I should think he might probably have that
line of Fletcher in his head,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How like a Swan she <small>SWIMS HER PACE</small>!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The expression, you see, is very like. ’Tis
true, the <i>image</i> in Milton is much nobler.
It is taken from a barge of state in a public
procession.</p>

<p>VI. We may even pronounce that a <i>single
word</i> is taken, when it is new and uncommon.</p>

<p>Milton’s calling a ray of light&mdash;a levell’d
<i>rule</i> in Comus v. 340, is so particular that,
when one reads in Euripides ἡλίου ΚΑΝΩΝ
σαφὴς, Suppl. v. 650, one has no doubt that
the learned poet translated the Greek word.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Pope’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Or ravish’d with the <i>whistling</i> of a name,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>is for the same reason, if there were no other
points of likeness, copied from Mr. Cowley’s</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Charm’d with the foolish <i>whistlings</i> of a name.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Transl. of Virgil’s <i>O! fortunati nimium</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>VII. An improper <i>use</i> of uncommon expression,
in very exact writers, will sometimes
create a suspicion. Milton had called the <i>sight</i>
indifferently <i>visual nerve</i> and <i>visual ray</i>,
P. L. iii. 620. xi. 415. Mr. Pope in his Messiah
thought he might take the same liberty,
but forgot that though the <i>visual nerve</i> might
be purged from film, the <i>visual ray</i> could not.
Had Mr. Pope <i>invented</i> this bold expression,
he would have seen to apply his <i>metaphor</i>
more properly.</p>

<p>VIII. Where the word or phrase is <i>foreign</i>,
there is, if possible, still less doubt.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;at last his sail-broad <i>vans</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spreads for flight.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Milton, P. L. ii. v. 927.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Most certainly from Tasso’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;Spiega al grand volo i <i>vanni</i>. ix.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And that of Jonson in his <i>Sejanus</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O! what is it proud slime will not believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own worth, to hear it <i>equal prais’d</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Thus with the Gods</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="author">A. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Juvenal’s</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;nihil est quod credere de se<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non possit, cum <i>laudatur Diis æqua</i> potestas.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>IX. Conclude the same when the expression
is <i>antique</i>, in the writer’s own language.</p>

<p>In Mr. Waller’s Panegyric on the Protector,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, when a Lion shakes his dreadful mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And angry grows, if he <i>that first took pain</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tame his youth, approach the haughty beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bends to him, but frights away the rest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The antique formality of the phrase <i>that
first took pain</i>, for, <i>that first took the pains</i>,
in so pure and modern a speaker, as this poet,
looks suspicious. He took it, as he found it
in an older writer. There are many other
marks of imitation, but we had needed no more
than this to make the discovery:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when a lion shakes his dreadful mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beats his tail, with courage proud, and wroth,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
<span class="i0">If his commander come, <i>who first took pain</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tame his youth, his lofty crest down go’th.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Fairfax’s <i>Tasso</i>, B. <small>VIII.</small> S. 83.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>X. You observe in most of the instances,
here given, besides other marks, there is an
identity of rhyme. And this circumstance of
itself, in our poetry, is no bad argument of
imitation, particularly when joined to a similarity
of expression. And the reason is, the
rhyme itself very naturally brings the expression
along with it.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. “Stuck o’er with titles, and hung round with strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou mayst be <i>by Kings, or whores of Kings</i>.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Essay on Man, E. <small>IV. V.</small> 205.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Mr. Cowley in his translation of <i>Hor.</i> 1.
<i>ep.</i> 10.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“To Kings, or to the favourites of Kings.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. “Such is the world’s great harmony, that <i>springs</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From order, union, full <i>consent of things</i>.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Ep. <small>III.</small> 295.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Denham’s <i>Cowper’s Hill</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Wisely she knew the <i>harmony of things</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1">As well as that of sounds from discord <i>springs</i>.”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. “Far as the solar walk, or milky way.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Essay on Man, Ep. <small>I. V.</small> 102.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Mr. Dryden’s Pindaric Poem to the
memory of K. Charles II.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Out of the solar walk, or heav’n’s high way.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though these consonancies chyming in the
writer’s head, he might not always be aware of
the imitation.</p>

<p>XI. In the examples, just given, there was
no reason to suspect the poet was imitating,
till you met with the original. Then indeed
the rhyme leads to the discovery. But “if
an exact writer falls into a <i>flatness of expression</i>
for the sake of rhyme, you may ev’n
previously conclude that he has some precedent
for it.”</p>

<p>In the famous lines,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let modest Foster, if he will, excell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten metropolitans <i>in preaching well</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Ep. to Satires, v. 131.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I used to suspect that the phrase of <i>preaching
well</i> so unlike the concise accuracy of Pope,
would not have been hazarded by him, if some
eminent writer, though perhaps of an older
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
age and less correct taste than his own, had
not set the example. But I had no doubt left
when I happened on the following couplet in
Mr. Waller.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your’s sounds aloud, and tells us you <i>excell</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less in courage, than <i>in singing well</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Poem to Sir W. D’Avenant.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Our great poet is more happy in the application
of these rhymes on another occasion,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let such teach others, who themselves <i>excell</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And censure freely, who have written <i>well</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Essay on Crit. v. 15.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The reason is apparent. But here he glanced
at the Duke of Buckingham’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Nature’s chief master-piece is <i>writing well</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>XII. “The same pause and turn of expression
are pretty sure symptoms of imitation.”
These minute resemblances do not
usually spring from Nature, which, when the
sentiment is the same, hath a hundred ways of
its own, of giving it to us.</p>

<p>1. That noble verse in the essay on criticism,
v. 625.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For fools rush in, where angels dare not tread,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is certainly fashion’d upon Shakespear’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">——————————“the world is grown so bad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wrens make prey, where angels dare not perch.”<br /></span>
<span class="author"><i>Rich.</i> III. A. <small>I</small>. S. <small>III</small>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>2. The verses to Sir W. Trumbal in Past. 1.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And carrying with you all the world can boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To all the world illustriously are lost.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Waller’s <i>Maid’s Tragedy</i> alter’d,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy he that from the world retires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carries with him what the world admires.<br /></span>
<span class="author">p. 215. Lond. 1712.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>XIII. When to these marks the same <i>Rhyme</i>
is added, the case is still more evident.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Men would be angels, angels would be Gods.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Essay on Man, Ep. I. v. 126.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Without all question from Sir Fulk Grevil,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men would be tyrants, tyrants would be <i>Gods</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="author">Works, <i>Lond.</i> 1633. p. 73.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>XIV. The seeming quaintness and obscurity
of an expression frequently indicates imitation.
As when in Fletcher’s <i>Pilgrim</i> we read,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Hummings</i> of higher nature vex his brains.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">A. <small>II.</small> S. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Had the idea been original, the poet had
expressed it more plainly. In leaving it thus,
he pays his reader the compliment to suppose,
that he will readily call to mind,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">aliena negotia centum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Per caput, et circa saliunt latus;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>which sufficiently explains it: As we may see
from Mr. Cowley’s application of the same passage.
“Aliena negotia centum per caput et
centum saliunt latus. A hundred businesses
of other men fly continually about his head
and <i>ears</i>, and strike him in the face like
Dorres.” <i>Disc. of Liberty.</i> And still more
clearly, from Mr. Pope’s,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A hundred other men’s affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like bees, are <i>humming</i> in my ears.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Learned writers of quick parts abound in
these delicate allusions. It makes a principal
part of modern elegancy to glance in this
oblique manner at well-known passages in the
classics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>XV. I will trouble you with but one more
note of <i>imitated expression</i>, and it shall be
the very reverse of the last. When the passages
glanced at are not familiar, the expression
is frequently minute and circumstantial, corresponding
to the original in the order, turn,
and almost number of the words. The reasons
are, that, the imitated passage not being
known, the imitator may give it, as he finds
it, with safety, or at least without offence;
and that, besides, the force and beauty of it
would escape us in a brief and general allusion.
The following are instances:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. “Man never is, but always to be blest.”<br /></span>
<span class="author">Essay on Man, Ep. I. v. 69.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>from Manilius,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Victuros agimus semper, nec vivimus unquam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. &mdash;“Hope never comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes to all.”&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>from Euripides in the Troad. v. 676.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;οὐδ’ ὃ πᾶσι λείπεται βροτοῖς,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ξύνεστιν ἐλπὶς.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>3. But above all, that in Jonson’s Catiline,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">“He shall die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shall</i> was too slowly said: He’s <i>dying</i>: That<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still too slow: He’s <i>dead</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>from Seneca’s <i>Hercules furens</i>, A. <small>III.</small></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lycus Creonti debitas poenas <i>dabit</i>:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lentum est, dabit; <i>dat</i>: hoc quoque est lentum; <i>dedit</i>.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>You have now, Sir, before you a specimen
of those rules, which I have fancied might be
fairly applied to the discovery of imitations,
both in regard to the <small>SENSE</small> and <small>EXPRESSION</small> of
great writers. I would not pretend that the
same stress is to be laid on <i>all</i>; but there may
be something, at least, worth attending to in
every one of them. It were easy, perhaps, to
enumerate still more, and to illustrate these I
have given with more agreeable citations. Yet
I have spared you the disgust of considering
those vulgar passages, which every body recollects
and sets down for acknowledged imitations.
And these I have used are taken from
the most celebrated of the ancient and modern
writers. You may observe indeed that I have
chiefly drawn from our own poets; which I
did, not merely because I know you despise
the pedantry of confining one’s self to learned
quotations, but because I think we are better
able to discern those circumstances, which betray
an imitation, in our own language than in
any other. Amongst other reasons, an <i>identity</i>
of words and phrases, upon which so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
much depends, especially in the article of <i>expression</i>,
is only to be had in the <i>same</i> language.
And you are not to be told with how much
more certainty we determine of the degree of
evidence, which such identity affords for this
purpose, in a language we speak, than in one
which we only lisp or spell.</p>

<p>But you will best understand of what importance
this affair of <i>expression</i> is to the
discovery of imitations, by considering how
seldom we are able to fix an imitation on
Shakespear. The reason is, not, that there
are not numberless passages in him very like
to others in approved authors, or that he had
not read enough to give us a fair hold of him;
but that his expression is so totally his own,
that he almost always sets us at defiance.</p>

<p>You will ask me, perhaps, now I am on
this subject, how it happened that Shakespear’s
language is every where so much his own as to
secure his imitations, if they were such, from
discovery; when I pronounce with such assurance
of those of our other poets. The
answer is given for me in the Preface to Mr.
Theobald’s Shakespear; though the observation,
I think, is too good to come from that
critic. It is, that, though his words, agreeably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
to the state of the English tongue at that
time, be generally Latin, his phraseology is
perfectly English: An advantage, he owed to
his slender acquaintance with the Latin idiom.
Whereas the other writers of his age, and such
others of an older date as were likely to fall
into his hands, had not only the most familiar
acquaintance with the Latin idiom, but affected
on all occasions to make use of it. Hence it
comes to pass, that, though he might draw
sometimes from the Latin (Ben Jonson, you
know, tells us, <i>He had less Greek</i>) and the
learned English writers, he takes nothing but
the <i>sentiment</i>; the expression comes of itself,
and is purely English.</p>

<p>I might indulge in other reflexions, and
detain you still further with examples taken
from his works. But we have <i>lain</i>, as the
Poet speaks, <i>on these primrose beds</i>, too long.
It is time that you now rise to your own nobler
<i>inventions</i>; and that I return myself to those,
less pleasing, perhaps, but more useful studies
from which your friendly sollicitations have
called me. Such as these amusements are,
however, I cannot repent me of them, since
they have been innocent at least, and even
ingenuous; and, what I am fondest to recollect,
have helped to enliven those many years of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
friendship we have passed together in this
place. I see indeed, with regret, the approach

myself, I must always bear about me the agreeable

Aristotle was of the same mind, as appears from his
definition of comedy, which, says he, is ΜΙΜΗΣΙΣ ΦΑΥΛΟΤΕΡΩΝ;
[κ. ε.] that is, <i>the imitation of characters</i>,
whatever be the distinct meaning of the term φαυλότεροι.
It is true, this critic, in his account of the origin of tragedy
and comedy, makes them both the imitations of <small>ACTIONS</small>.
Οἱ μὲν σεμνότεροι ΤΑΣ ΚΑΛΑΣ ἐμιμοῦντο ΠΡΑΞΕΙΣ, οἱ
δὲ εὐτελέστεροι ΤΑΣ τῶν φαύλων. [κ. δ.] Yet, even here, the
expression is so put, as if he had been conscious that
<i>persons</i>, not <i>actions</i>, were the direct object of comedy.
And the quotation, now alledged from another place,
where a definition is given more in form, shews, that this
was, in effect, his sentiment.</p></div>

The neglect of this is one of the greatest defects in
the <i>modern drama</i>; which in nothing falls so much short
of the perfection of the Greek scene as in this want of
simplicity in the construction of its fable. The good sense
of the author of the <i>History of the Italian Theatre</i> (who,
though a mere player, appears to have had juster notions
of the drama, than the generality of even professed critics)
was sensibly struck with this difference in <i>tragedy</i>.
“Quant &agrave; l’unit&eacute; d’action, says he, je trouve un grande
difference entre les tragedies Grecques et les tragedies
Fran&ccedil;oises; j’apper&ccedil;ois to&ucirc;jours a&iacute;s&eacute;ment l’action des
tragedies Grecques, et je ne la perds point de v&ucirc;e; mais
dans les tragedies Fran&ccedil;oises, j’avo&uuml;e, que j’ai souvent
bien de la peine &agrave; dem&ecirc;ler l’action des episodes, dont
elle est charg&eacute;e.” [<i>Hist. du Theatre Italian</i>, par <span class="smcap">Louis

Οἱ μὲν σεμνότεροι τὰς καλὰς ἐμιμοῦντο πράξεις, καὶ τὰς τῶν τοιούτων
τύχας· οἱ δὲ εὐτελέστεροι, τὰς τῶν φαύλων, ΠΡΩΤΟΝ ΨΟΓΟΥΣ ΠΟΙΟΥΝΤΕΣ,
ΩΣΠΕΡ ἙΤΕΡΟΙ ΥΜΝΟΥΣ ΚΑΙ ΕΓΚΩΜΙΑ.
[ΠΕΡ. ΠΟΙΗΤ. κδ.] This is Aristotle’s account
of the origin of the different <i>species of</i> <small>POETRY</small>. They
were occasioned, he says, by the different and even opposite
<i>tempers and dispositions of men: those of a loftier spirit
delighting in the encomiastic poetry, while the humbler sort
betook themselves to satire</i>. But this, also, is the just account
of the rise and character of the different <i>species of
the</i> <span class="smcap">Drama</span>. For they grew up, he tells us in this very
chapter, from the <span class="smcap">Dithyrambic</span>, and <span class="smcap">Phallic</span> songs.
And who were the <i>men</i>, who chaunted <i>these</i>, but the
ΣΕΜΝΟΤΕΡΟΙ, and ΕΥΤΕΛΕΣΤΕΡΟΙ, before-mentioned?
And how were they <i>employed</i> in them, <i>but the former, in
hymning the praises of Bacchus; the latter, in dealing about
obscene jokes and taunting invectives on each other</i>? So that
the <i>characters</i> of the men, and their <i>subjects</i>, being exactly
the same in <i>both</i>, what is said of the <i>one</i> is equally applicable
to the <i>other</i>. It was proper to observe this, or the
reader might, perhaps, object to the use made of this passage,
<i>here</i>, as well as <i>above</i>, where it is brought to illustrate
Aristotle’s notion of the <i>natures</i> of the tragic and
comic poetry.</p></div>

So the great philosopher, ὃ γὰρ περὶ ἐνίας συμβαίνει
πάθος ψυχὰς ἰσχυρῶς, τοῦτο ἐν πάσαις ὑπάρχει. τῷ δὲ ἧττον
διαφέρει, καὶ τῷ μᾶλλον. ΠΟΛΙΤ. Θ. Whence our Hobbes
seems to have taken his aphorism, which he makes the
corner-stone of his philosophy. “That for the similitude
of the thoughts and passions of one man to the thoughts
and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself,
and considereth what he doth, when he does <i>think,
opine, reason, hope, fear</i>, &amp;c. and upon what grounds;
he shall thereby read and know, what are the thoughts
and passions of all other men, upon the like occasions.”</p>
